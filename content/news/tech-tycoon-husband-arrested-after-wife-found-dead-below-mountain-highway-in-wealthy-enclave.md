While early findings noted injuries consistent with a fall, the San Bernardino County Coroner later ruled her death a homicide.</p><p>Sheriff’s officials have not disclosed how detectives linked Goodarzi to Papoli’s death or whether a motive has been identified, saying only that an "extensive and persistent investigation into the circumstances" led them to identify him as a suspect. Goodarzi is being held without bail at the Central Detention Center.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-farming-tycoon-arrested-wifes-killing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CALIFORNIA FARMING TYCOON ARRESTED IN WIFE'S KILLING</strong></a></p><p>Court records show Papoli filed for divorce just five months before her death, citing "irreconcilable differences," according to documents <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/26/us-news/inside-the-bitter-divorce-of-socal-tech-ceo-gordon-abas-goodarzi-and-his-murdered-wife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained by The California Post.</a> The June 12, 2025 filing sought spousal support and the division of millions of dollars in shared assets.</p><p>More than $4.5 million in property was at stake, the outlet reported, including the Rolling Hills Estates home where Goodarzi was arrested, a residence in Chino Hills, industrial property in Massachusetts, vacant land in Southern California and another property in Crestline, the same town where Papoli’s body was later found.</p><p>Papoli and Goodarzi were married for 28 years. Goodarzi, an engineer and tech executive, sold his clean energy company, US Hybrid, for $50 million in 2021, according to The California Post. Papoli’s divorce filing requested Goodarzi pay her legal fees, while his response asked the court to have each party cover their own costs.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-farming-tycoon-accused-fatally-shooting-wife-through-window-amid-fight-over-fortune-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CALIFORNIA FARMING TYCOON ACCUSED OF FATALLY SHOOTING WIFE THROUGH WINDOW AMID FIGHT OVER FORTUNE: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>The divorce proceedings were terminated Dec. 23 due to Papoli’s death, according to her attorney.</p><p>Charging documents filed by the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office</a> allege Papoli was "particularly vulnerable" and that the killing involved "planning, sophistication, and professionalism," according to the filing.</p><p>Goodarzi’s arraignment, which was scheduled for Tuesday morning, was continued to Thursday, the DA’s office confirmed.</p><p>Papoli was not immediately identified when her body was discovered.
