<p>A suspect accused of setting fire to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/mississippi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mississippi synagogue</a> once bombed by the Ku Klux Klan admitted he targeted the building because it is a Jewish house of worship and was turned into police after a laughing confession to his father, the FBI said Monday.</p><p>Stephen Pittman, 19, was charged in federal court with maliciously damaging or destroying a building by fire or explosive in connection with the weekend arson at Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson.</p><p>According to an FBI affidavit, Pittman admitted to lighting the fire inside the synagogue, referring to it as "the synagogue of Satan." Authorities said Pittman’s father contacted the FBI after he observed burns on Pittman’s ankles, hands and face, and hearing his son confess to setting the building on fire.</p><p>"Pittman laughed as he told his father what he did and said he finally got them," the FBI said in the document, according to <a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2026/01/12/father-pleaded-with-son-come-home-prior-starting-synagogue-fire-court-docs-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WLBT-TV</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/we-warned-them-jewish-leader-says-after-bondi-beach-terror-attack-kills-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>‘WE WARNED THEM’ JEWISH LEADER SAYS AFTER BONDI BEACH TERROR ATTACK THAT KILLS 15</strong></a></p><p>Pittman made his first appearance Monday in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/federal-courts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. District Court</a> via video from a hospital bed, where both of his hands were visibly bandaged.
