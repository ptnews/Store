There are others that left because they saw the writing on the wall."</p><p>Dan said the behavior felt unpredictable and deeply unsettling, particularly because it often appeared calculated.</p><p><strong>WATCH: ‘REAL HOUSEWIVES’ STAR RAN A CULT-LIKE CHURCH, FAMILY MEMBERS SAY</strong></p><p>"There's two sides of Robert… almost a double personality," Dan said. "You just see his true form come out — a total Jekyll-and-Hyde … He would preach and actually call out people in the church and ridicule them … it was just embarrassing."</p><p>Over time, Dan noted, the behavior escalated to public humiliation during church services.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/real-housewives-salt-lake-city-mary-cosby-not-included-filming-season-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>‘REAL HOUSEWIVES’ STAR MARY COSBY WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN FILMING FOR SALT LAKE CITY’S SEASON 3: SOURCE</strong></a></p><p>"You were just afraid to leave. People were afraid of leaving," he said. "This is detrimental to people."</p><p>For Dan, his time at Faith Temple revealed what he describes as a disturbing pattern of abuse masked as spiritual guidance. He said that church leadership frequently exploited members’ faith to enforce obedience and loyalty.</p><p>In the docuseries, Dan alleged he endured physical punishments and witnessed abuse as a child — including kneeling on pins and needles and watching another child beaten. Robert Cosby Sr., a military veteran, is accused of shoving Dan during a prayer session, which Dan said became a turning point that prompted him to leave the church.</p><p>"To understand, I think that ‘The Cult of the Real Housewife’ points out trauma is real and that people will manipulate that and make you think that God is a certain way," he told Fox News Digital. "They'll put their own righteousness into what they believe."</p><p>He cautioned that such manipulation can be subtle, making it hard for members to recognize that they are being exploited.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/josh-duggars-cousin-recalls-haunting-words-reality-star-confronted-abuse-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JOSH DUGGAR'S COUSIN RECALLS HAUNTING WORDS WHEN REALITY STAR WAS CONFRONTED WITH ABUSE ALLEGATIONS</strong></a></p><p>"I think this is bringing light to — people could be in a cult and not even realize that they’re in one," he said.</p><p>Financial pressure was central to the alleged control, Dan said, with members shamed for failing to give.</p><p>"It wasn’t necessarily what’s going to happen to you … but the pressure that you know you had to give more and [being told] ‘you’re cheap,’" he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scripture was used</a> to reinforce guilt, making members feel condemned.</p><p>"They would put all types of pressure related to scriptures," he said, adding that members were made to feel condemned. "But when you involve your faith and when you think that you're doing the right thing, and they put this guilty conscience on you that you are going to hell, damnation to you, that if you're not going to give."</p><p>Dan described one of the most damaging tactics as invoking the legacy of "Mama," the church’s beloved founder, whose teachings emphasized personal faith and moral agency.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/former-countess-luann-de-lesseps-advises-sarah-ferguson-how-survive-epstein-scandal-public-downfall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FORMER COUNTESS LUANN DE LESSEPS ADVISES SARAH FERGUSON ON HOW TO SURVIVE EPSTEIN SCANDAL, PUBLIC DOWNFALL</strong></a></p><p>"One of Mama's messages was, ‘Know God for yourself,’" Dan said.

"If I said I’m going to go home and cook… then I’m putting him above God."</p><p>She added, "It was always a competition … if I didn’t do what they said, then I’m putting my husband above God."</p><p>"Mama" Cosby’s approach, Kim said, was one of unity and support — a stark contrast to the divisive tactics she claimed emerged after leadership changes within the church.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
