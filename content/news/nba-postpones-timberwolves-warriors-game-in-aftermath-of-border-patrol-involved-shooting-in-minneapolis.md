Good, according to Noem, refused and "attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle."</p><p>"Our thoughts are with her family and everyone affected, and our hearts are with our community as we hope for healing and unity during this challenging time," the arena's public-address announcer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/timberwolves-hold-moment-silence-minnesota-woman-killed-ice-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said at the time</a>.</p><p>Warriors head coach <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/steve-kerr-gives-strong-reaction-shameful-minnesota-ice-shooting-calls-murder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Kerr</a> called Good's killing "murder."</p><p>"It’s shameful, really, that in our country we can have law enforcement officers who commit murder and seemingly get away with it. It’s shameful that the government can come out and lie about what happened when there’s video and witnesses who have all come out and disputed what the government is saying," Kerr said.</p><p>"So, very demoralizing, devastating to lose anyone’s life, especially in that manner. So, it’s terrible, terribly sad for her family and for her and that city."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lakers-lebron-james-shrugs-off-reported-tension-jeanie-buss-it-dont-bother-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LAKERS' LEBRON JAMES SHRUGS OFF REPORTED TENSION WITH JEANIE BUSS: 'IT DON'T BOTHER ME'</strong></a></p><p>The Timberwolves and Warriors both referred to the NBA's statement in emails to Fox News Digital.</p><p>Minneapolis officials have since identified the individual killed on Saturday as a 37-year-old White man who is a resident of Minneapolis and is believed to be a U.S. citizen.

Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene," DHS said. </p><p>"The suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID — this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement."</p><p>DHS said after the incident that approximately 200 agitators arrived and began to "obstruct and assault law enforcement," leading to crowd-control measures.</p><p>Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> urged the agents to leave his state after the shooting.</p><p><i>Fox News' Rachel Wolf, Paul Mauro, and Bill Melugin contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
