<p>Another top head coach candidate is off the board in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami Dolphins</a>, who moved on from Mike McDaniel after a 35-33 record through four seasons, are reportedly hiring ex-Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley to be their next head coach, according to multiple reports.</p><p>Hafley completed his second interview with Miami on Monday, and the Dolphins clearly loved what they heard again from the man who has been making a name for himself the past two seasons in Green Bay.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href="http://FOXNEWS.COM"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>While Hafley had head coaching experience, spending four years from 2020-23 as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/boston-college" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston College</a>’s leader on the sideline, he has never held the role in the NFL.</p><p>The hire makes tons of sense when you look at the first one owner Stephen Ross and the Dolphins made this offseason.</p><p>Jon-Eric Sullivan was brought in as first-year general manager after working his way through the Packers’ front office since 2004, ultimately serving as vice president of player personnel over the past four seasons.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dolphins-darren-waller-says-he-kicked-out-exit-meeting-coach-mike-mcdaniel-before-firing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOLPHINS' DARREN WALLER SAYS HE WAS KICKED OUT OF EXIT MEETING WITH COACH MIKE MCDANIEL BEFORE FIRING</strong></a></p><p>With Sullivan aboard, Ross stayed in the family, hiring Hafley with support from his new GM.</p><p>Hafley, 46, has seen success in Green Bay on the defensive side of the ball, with his unit ranking 9th in yards allowed per game over the past two seasons. The Packers’ defense has also allowed the eighth-fewest points per game over that span.</p><p>During his four years with Boston College as head coach, Hafley owned a 22-26 record. And that came after years of work in the NFL with various teams.</p><p>Hafley spent time as a defensive backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers from 2012-18. And he bounced around college before that, beginning with Worcester Polytechnic Institute as their running backs coach before stops at Albany, Pittsburgh, Rutgers and Ohio State.</p><p>Hafley was the Buckeyes’ defensive coordinator during the 2019 season before heading to Boston College.</p><p>As they look ahead to his new regime in Miami, both Hafley and Sullivan must answer the biggest question for the franchise: Is Tua Tagovailoa still the answer at quarterback?</p><p>Tagovailoa was not mentioned when Sullivan was discussing building blocks for the team moving into 2026 while speaking with local media members. He signed a four-year extension in July 2024 for $212.4 million — the most expensive contract in franchise history.</p><p>But Tagovailoa has struggled in his 25 games since then, especially in 2025 with 15 interceptions to 20 touchdowns. He owns a 12-13 record in the last two seasons with the Dolphins.</p><p>The Dolphins do have some key figures to build around, though, including De’Von Achane being one of the top running backs in the NFL.</p><p>Miami has missed the playoffs the past two seasons and has not secured a playoff victory since 2000. The team will hope Hafley can change that right away.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
