<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Monday he would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"take up arms"</a> against the U.S. if it attacks his country, following U.S. military action in Venezuela and the capture and arrest of President Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>Petro, a former member of the leftist M-19 guerrilla movement that demobilized in the early 1990s, made the remarks in a <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2008063024343515623" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post on X</a> after President Trump suggested Colombia could be the next target in his administration’s war on drugs.</p><p>"Although I have not been a military man, I know about war and clandestinity," Petro wrote in a post translated to English from Spanish.
