<p>A tense debate over Iran turned confrontational on "Piers Morgan Uncensored" after Iranian-born former Canadian politician Goldie Ghamari accused "The Young Turks" host Cenk Uygur of spreading "jihadi Islamist propaganda" during a roundtable on anti-regime protests and U.S. policy.</p><p>The political commentators appeared on Morgan’s show Tuesday to discuss widespread <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-regime protests in Iran</a> that have resulted in a deadly crackdown by the government and internet blackouts, according to human rights activists.</p><p>President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-announces-final-25-tariff-countries-doing-business-iran-regime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>threatened action against the regime</u></a>, warning Tehran in multiple Truth Social posts to stop killing its people.</p><p>Uygur <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwDWoYcmpxs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warned</a> against American intervention, arguing it would be counterproductive and risk repeating past foreign policy failures.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-shuts-down-airspace-foreign-officials-warn-against-travel-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN SHUTS DOWN AIRSPACE, FOREIGN OFFICIALS WARN AGAINST TRAVEL TO ISRAEL</strong></a></p><p>"And I guarantee you that both Israel and America do not want democracy in Iran," he said. "What they want instead is a puppet leader. So, they will bring in the former shah, a king, a dictator who will do everything that Israel wants, and then the Iranian people will revolt against him, and then we'll go through the cycle again and again and again."</p><p>Ghamari sharply responded, arguing Uygur did not understand the plight of Iranians. As she began her response, the two quickly started interrupting each other.</p><p>"I mean, first of all, Cenk is not Iranian, so he has no idea what's going on in occupied Iran," Ghamari said. "Pretty sure Cenk doesn't speak Persian either."</p><p>Uygur cut in to correct Ghamari with, "No, actually, it's Farsi."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-allegedly-airs-97-coercive-confessions-amid-record-breaking-north-korea-style-internet-blackout" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN ALLEGEDLY AIRS 97 'COERCIVE CONFESSIONS' AMID RECORD-BREAKING NORTH KOREA-STYLE INTERNET BLACKOUT</strong></a></p><p>"Persian is the English word for Farsi," she retorted. "So, don't correct me when I'm speaking, and don't interrupt me. I let you speak your garbage jihadi Islamist propaganda."</p><p>Ghamari responded that Uygur did not have the right to interrupt her as she spoke "on behalf of 90 million Iranians," and the back-and-forth continued.</p><p>"You're not speaking on behalf of all Iranians," Uygur said, before asking Ghamari when she was elected by the people of Iran.</p><p>"Yes I am," she responded.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/g7-threatens-iran-new-sanctions-nationwide-protest-crackdown-killing-thousands" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>G7 THREATENS IRAN WITH NEW SANCTIONS OVER NATIONWIDE PROTEST CRACKDOWN KILLING THOUSANDS</strong></a></p><p>"Why are you speaking over me?" Ghamari repeated before slamming Uygur's comments again as "garbage propaganda."</p><p>Uygur disputed that she spoke for Iranians, and the exchange continued as Morgan attempted to move the discussion forward.</p><p>After the interruption-heavy exchange, Ghamari went on to argue that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was "not actually a revolution," calling it "an Islamic coup d'état" and saying Iranians were trying to "rectify" what she described as a decades-long mistake. </p><p>She also referenced exiled <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-exiled-iranian-prince-seems-very-nice-doubts-whether-he-has-backing-lead-country" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iranian Prince Reza Pahlavi</a>, arguing the country should "return our king," and described Iran as a "constitutional monarchy" prior to 1979.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/freed-iranian-prisoner-says-in-trump-islamic-republic-has-met-its-match" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FREED IRANIAN PRISONER SAYS ‘IN TRUMP, THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC HAS MET ITS MATCH’</strong></a></p><p>Ghamari did not immediately respond to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital’s</a> request for comment. Uygur mocked Ghamari's claim that he was spreading Islamist propaganda in a comment to Fox News Digital.</p><p>"That’s hilarious. I’m atheist," he said. "These propagandists will say anything to drag America into a war. If Israel wants this war, why don’t they pay for it and fight it themselves? We should stop fighting Israel’s wars for it. We should stand up for American interests instead."</p><p>The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), <a href="https://www.en-hrana.org/day-eighteen-of-the-protests-global-focus-on-casualties-and-mass-arrests-amid-communications-blackout/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>which tracks</u></a> human rights violations in Iran, said Wednesday that nationwide protests continued into an 18th day as authorities maintained a near-total internet shutdown.</p><p>On Thursday, supporters of the Iranian regime <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iranian-protestors-hold-trump-assassination-attempt-photo-chant-death-america-state-media-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chanted "death to America"</a> and held signs calling for the assassination of President Trump.</p><p><i>Fox News' Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.</i></p>
