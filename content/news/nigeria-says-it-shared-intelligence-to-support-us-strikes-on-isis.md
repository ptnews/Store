<p>Nigeria said it shared intelligence with the U.S. ahead of Christmas night <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-launches-christmas-night-airstrikes-isis-terrorist-scum-nigeria-after-killings-christians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">airstrikes on ISIS targets</a> in the country.</p><p>The Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on Friday that it was "engaged in structured security cooperation" with other nations, including the U.S., adding that the cooperation "led to precision hits on terrorist targets." The ministry said that the joint security efforts include the sharing of intelligence and strategic coordination.</p><p>"Nigeria reiterates that all counter-terrorism efforts are guided by the primacy of protecting civilian lives, safeguarding national unity, and upholding the rights and dignity of all citizens, irrespective of faith or ethnicity. Terrorist violence in any form whether directed at Christians, Muslims, or other communities remains an affront to Nigeria’s values and to international peace and security," the ministry wrote in a statement <a href="https://x.com/NigeriaMFA/status/2004346591403180167" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trumps-warning-nigeria-offers-hope-nations-persecuted-christians" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP’S WARNING TO NIGERIA OFFERS HOPE TO NATION'S PERSECUTED CHRISTIANS</strong></a></p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> announced the Christmas night airstrikes in northwest Nigeria, saying the targets were ISIS militants who he accused of killing Christians. The president also included a warning that further attacks would take place if the violence against Christians continued.</p><p>"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>ISIS Terrorist Scum</u></a> in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!" Trump said Thursday on Truth Social. </p><p>"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.</p><p>"Under my leadership, our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper," he continued. "May God Bless our Military, and MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, including the dead Terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/nigerian-christian-leader-calls-trumps-spotlight-violence-nigeria-answered-prayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NIGERIAN CHRISTIAN LEADER CALLS TRUMP'S SPOTLIGHT ON VIOLENCE IN NIGERIA AN 'ANSWERED PRAYER'</strong></a></p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, Christian charity, Open Doors said its sources in Nigeria said, "the airstrikes have hit terrorist camps in Jabo, a rural community in Tambuwal Local Government Area of Sokoto State, with multiple ISIS militants reportedly killed.</p><p>Jabo is a predominantly Fulani town in Sokoto State and has been identified as a haven for militants and a link to neighboring states like Kebbi and Zamfara. To the best of our knowledge there is no church presence in Jabo.</p><p>Right now, there are fears of retaliation because of the airstrike."</p><p>Open Doors is a global Christian charity supporting Christians persecuted for their faith.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-ambassador-michael-waltz-declares-atrocities-against-christians-nigeria-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US AMBASSADOR MICHAEL WALTZ DECLARES ATROCITIES AGAINST CHRISTIANS IN NIGERIA 'GENOCIDE'</strong></a></p><p>U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz, who has been outspoken about the violence against Christians in Nigeria, praised the strikes. The ambassador said the precision strikes showed Christians in Nigeria and around the world that Trump would "fight for them."</p><p>Last month, Trump threatened to "do things in Nigeria that Nigeria is not going to be happy about" and "go into that now disgraced country guns-a-blazing."</p><p>That warning set the stage for the Christmas-night strikes, which Secretary of War <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pete-hegseth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pete Hegseth</a> said fulfilled the president’s demand that the killings stop. Hegseth also included in a <a href="https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/2004332431542022289" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on X</a> a reference to the U.S.-Nigeria cooperation that led to the strikes.</p><p>"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end," Hegseth wrote on X.
