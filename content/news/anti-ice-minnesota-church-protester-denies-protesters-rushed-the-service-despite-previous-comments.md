<p>Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the organizers of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/video-shows-anti-ice-agitator-berating-christians-minnesota-church-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>storming of a Minnesota church</u></a> to protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday, denied that she and her group tried to "rush" the church on CNN, despite previous comments suggesting otherwise.</p><p>Armstrong appeared on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" Wednesday when she was asked about whether the Justice Department had contacted her since threatening a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bondi-vows-accountability-after-church-attack-says-minnesota-a-mess-right-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crackdown on the protesters</a>.</p><p>Armstrong said that she had not been contacted by the Justice Department, despite media attention, but that she wanted to "correct" the record on her protest.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minnesota-socialists-tell-workers-fake-sick-leave-anti-ice-protests-across-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA SOCIALISTS TELL WORKERS TO FAKE SICK LEAVE FOR ANTI-ICE PROTESTS</strong></a></p><p>"We did not rush into that church," Armstrong said. "We actually went and sat down and participated in the service. And after the pastor prayed, that is when I stood up and asked him a question in response to his prayer. And then he responded to me. And then I proceeded to ask him about Pastor David Easterwood and how is it possible for him to serve as both a pastor and the director of ICE for Minnesota?"</p><p>She continued, "And instead of responding to me, as soon as I said the name David Easterwood, the pastor said, 'shame, shame.' And that is when I led us in chants 'Justice for Renee Good' and ‘Hands up, don’t shoot.' So I want to clarify that we didn't rush in. We didn't bust in. We were a part of the service until I got up and posed that question to the pastor."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyt-slammed-over-report-saying-protest-minnesota-church-service-adds-tensions-over-ice-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NYT SLAMMED OVER REPORT SAYING PROTEST AT MINNESOTA CHURCH SERVICE 'ADDS TO TENSIONS OVER ICE TACTICS'</u></strong></a></p><p>Though Armstrong claimed that her group did not "rush" into the church, she previously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ctuhv-cck&amp;rco=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told former CNN host Don Lemon</a> ahead of the protest that they were planning to "disrupt business as usual."</p><p>"This is Operation Pull Up, more of a clandestine operation. We show up somewhere that is a key location. They don't expect us to come there, and then we disrupt business as usual. So that's what we're about to go do right now. We've had a lot of success with the times we have done Operation Pull Up," Armstrong told Lemon.</p><p>In another comment, she told Lemon, "They cannot pretend to be a house of God while harboring someone who is directing ICE agents to wreak havoc upon our community and who killed Renee Good, who almost killed a 6-month-old baby. Enough is enough."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/st-paul-pastor-denounces-anti-ice-agitators-who-disrupted-church-service-says-were-here-worship-jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ST PAUL PASTOR DENOUNCES ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO DISRUPTED CHURCH SERVICE, SAYS 'WE'RE HERE TO WORSHIP JESUS'</u></strong></a></p><p>Before the Sunday service disruption, Armstrong caused controversy through her far-left views and activism. She has also been a key organizer of the boycotts against Target over its decision to scale back its diversity, equity and inclusion programs.</p><p>Armstrong has also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/far-left-agitator-who-organized-minnesota-church-storming-raked-over-1-million-from-nonprofit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raked in over $1 million</a> during six years leading a Minneapolis civil rights nonprofit that addresses anti-poverty issues.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a> reached out to Armstrong for comment.</p>
