<p>As the country braces for a major winter storm this weekend, heart health experts have shared warnings of the physical strain shoveling can take — particularly for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older adults</a>.</p><p>A 2025 Mayo Clinic review found that just 10 minutes of heavy snow shoveling can push the heart to about 97% of its maximum rate. Exposure to cold air was also found to increase blood pressure and reduce coronary blood flow.</p><p>While there isn’t an official age that’s "too old" to shovel, some cardiologists recommend that individuals over 45 should exercise more caution to lower their chances of a cardiac event.</p><p>"While there's no strict age cutoff, generally above the age of mid 40s and above, we tend to be a little more cautious — particularly in people who are less active [without] <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular exercise</a>," Dr. Navjot Kaur Sobti, M.D., an interventional cardiologist at Northwell’s Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, previously told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"Certainly in people who are above the age of 65 — and who have risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health/cholesterol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high cholesterol</a>, diabetes, obesity or sedentary lifestyle — we recommend being very, very cautious about shoveling snow," she advised.</p><p>Dr. John Osborne, M.D., a practicing Texas cardiologist and volunteer for the American Heart Association, shared similar guidance for people older than 45, especially males over 65.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/simple-nightly-habit-linked-healthier-blood-pressure-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SIMPLE NIGHTLY HABIT LINKED TO HEALTHIER BLOOD PRESSURE, STUDY SUGGESTS</u></strong></a></p><p>"Unless you are in good cardiovascular shape and condition, it may be a good idea to ask someone for help," he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.</p><p>The impact of snow removal is especially concerning for those with existing cardiovascular risks and a history of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart attack or stroke</a>, according to the cardiologist. "People with these characteristics and those who have had bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty simply should not be shoveling snow in any conditions," he said.</p><p>Osbourne said he often sees cardiac episodes in people who are typically sedentary and sit at a computer most of the day with little or no exercise. </p><p>"Then once or twice a year, they go out and try to shovel the driveway after a <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/category/snow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy snowfall</a>, and that unexpected exertion can unfortunately lead to tragedy."</p><p>The stress that is placed on one’s heart while shoveling snow is similar to what occurs during a cardiac stress test, Sobti pointed out, and may even exceed it.</p><p>Cold temperatures can cause blood vessels to constrict and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood pressure to spike</a> — which, coupled with existing hypertension and the exertion of lifting snow, can significantly tax the heart, she warned.</p><p>"It's almost like an at-risk person is putting themselves through an unsupervised maximal exertion stress test without a cardiologist actively monitoring them," Sobti told Fox News Digital.</p><p>In addition to the exertion of shoveling, frigid temperatures can also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strain the heart</a>. Recent research has shown that cold exposure accounts for nearly twice as many cardiovascular deaths as heat exposure, including heat exhaustion.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>That study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine last month, also found that those over age 65 had higher rates of temperature-related deaths.</p><p>"So the risk is very, very high," Sobti cautioned. "It's really that sudden rise in blood pressure coupled with the physical stress of snow shoveling itself."</p><p>The cardiologist said it’s ideal to have someone else help with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather/winter-storm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snow removal</a> — but if you do choose to use a shovel, she recommends pacing yourself and using a "pushing or sweeping" motion instead of heavy lifting.</p><p>To protect against the cold, Sobti also recommends covering your mouth, nose and extremities, wearing a hat and gloves, and using extra caution in windy conditions.</p><p>Using an automated snow blower can still raise the heart rate — up to 120 beats per minute, compared to 170 while shoveling, the American Heart Association states on its website.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>It is also important to be aware of any symptoms of a potential cardiac issue while shoveling, Sobti emphasized.</p><p>If a person starts to experience warning signs such as chest pain, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortness of breath</a>, a racing heart or palpitations, those should not be ignored.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>Even if the symptoms resolve after a few minutes, a person "could still be experiencing symptoms of a heart attack" and should call 911 for evaluation, Sobti said.</p><p>"It's better really to be safe than sorry."</p>
