<p>A hoard of hundreds of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/ancient-rome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roman-era silver coins</a> and precious metals was recovered in northern Germany — years after it went unreported to authorities.</p><p>The find was announced by the Lower Saxony State Office for the Preservation of Monuments (NLD) in October. It was found near Borsum, in the district of Hildesheim.</p><p>The hoard consisted of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/discover-luxury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">450 silver coins</a>, bars of silver, a gold ring and a gold coin.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/couple-stunned-tudor-era-treasure-surfaces-garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COUPLE STUNNED AS TUDOR-ERA TREASURE SURFACES BENEATH THEIR BACKYARD GARDEN</strong></a></p><p>German officials said the 2,000-year-old hoard was discovered by a detectorist in 2017 — but it wasn't until April 2025 that he reported it.</p><p>NLD archaeologists headed to the site in October to find exactly where the hoard was taken, and to "recover objects still in the ground," the organization said.</p><p>"Particular attention was paid to the question whether — despite the destroyed context of the find — information about the type of burial 2,000 years ago could still be obtained through the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improper excavation</a> in 2017," the statement added. </p><p>"As part of this investigation, additional coins were found; the treasure trove was completely recovered after the excavation was completed."</p><p>The NLD also described the treasure as "one of the largest treasure troves of Roman coins in Lower Saxony."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a><br><br>"Given the present state of knowledge, the coins can be dated to the early Roman Empire, a time of co-existence, juxtaposition and opposition between Romans and Germanic peoples," the statement said. </p><p>Officials cautioned that a comprehensive scientific analysis was still needed.</p><p>"Only then can it be assessed where the artifacts came from and why they were buried here," said the NLD. "Were they Romans or Germanic peoples?"</p><p>The detectorist who found the hoard will not face <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal repercussions</a>, as the statute of limitations expired, officials said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>Sebastian Messal, an archaeologist at NLD, told Fox News Digital that treasures like this are rare to find in Lower Saxony, but not unheard of.</p><p>"Comparable discoveries are nevertheless well known in the region… Among other examples, 3,000 coins were recovered in Jever, and more than 1,100 Roman coins are known from Lengerich," he said.</p><p>As of mid-January, Messal added that the finds are still awaiting scientific analysis — but the scientific value of the hoard is "enormous."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>The hoard's monetary value has not been reviewed. Messal noted that a single <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/ancient-roman-soldiers-monthly-paycheck-unearthed-pristine-condition-countryside" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roman denarius</a> can fetch up to 130 euros depending on its condition.</p><p>How the hoard was buried in the first place remains unclear, Messal said, because the detectorist's improper excavation destroyed the original archaeological context.</p><p>He also added that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it's unusual to keep</a> these types of finds secret.</p><p>"There is a legal obligation to report such discoveries in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lower Saxony</a>… New finds like these should, of course, be excavated under proper scientific conditions," he added.</p>
