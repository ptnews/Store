<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> called in a holy reinforcement before Sunday’s divisional showdown against the Baltimore Ravens, and it seemed to have worked. </p><p>Before kickoff on Sunday night, a priest was seen blessing the end zone where Ravens kicker <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/baltimore-ravens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ravens kicker Tyler Loop</a> would eventually miss the would-be walk-off field goal that would have sent Baltimore into the playoffs. </p><p>"This is a priest who is spreading holy water in that end zone," NBC play-by-play announcer Mike Tirico said after the game during the "Sunday Night Football" broadcast. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catholic community</a> in Pittsburgh is really strong, and its ties to the Steelers are everywhere," Tirico added with a laugh. "And down at that end zone, Tyler Loop misses the field goal and allows the Steelers to win."</p><p> "So it’s not Tyler Loop’s fault," Cris Collinsworth chuckled. </p><p>"As with everything in football, it’s at a higher power," Tirico responded. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ravens-season-ends-heartbreak-missed-walk-off-field-goal-gives-steelers-final-playoff-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>RAVENS' SEASON ENDS IN HEARTBREAK AS MISSED WALK-OFF FIELD GOAL GIVES STEELERS FINAL PLAYOFF SPOT</u></strong></a></p><p>Loop, who was drafted by the Ravens in the sixth round of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 NFL Draft,</a> had a chance to clinch the AFC North title for the Ravens and secure their place in the playoffs when he lined up for the 44-yard field goal attempt. </p><p>But the rookie’s kick sailed wide right just as time expired, sending the Steelers into the playoffs and ending the Ravens’ season on a heartbreaking note.</p><p>"I just want to say I’m super grateful to Baltimore – the organization, the city – just how they’ve embraced me this year. It’s been incredible," Loop said, speaking to reporters in the locker room. "For it to end like that just sucks, and I want to do better." </p><p>Loop said he wrote down a prayer before the game, which he returned to read after the missed field goal.</p><p>"Faith is a big part of my life," he said. "It’s such a fortunate thing to be here, even going back – just being placed in Baltimore with this team has been the biggest blessing of my life, and I’m super grateful for it."   </p><p> <i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
