<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new mobile app</a> from China is going viral for a reason that feels both unsettling and familiar. It exists to answer one basic question for people who live alone: Are you still alive? The app is called "Are You Dead?" and it has surged to the top of China's paid app charts. It also climbed into the top ten paid apps in the United States. Its popularity reflects more than curiosity. It highlights how many people now live by themselves and worry about what happens if something goes wrong.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

After paying about $1.15, users add an emergency contact and agree to check in every two days.</p><p>Here is how it works in practice:</p><p>That is it. No tracking. No health data. No constant monitoring. The goal is reassurance, not surveillance. On its English-language page, the app goes by the name Demumu. The developers describe it as a "lightweight safety tool" meant to make solitary life feel less risky. For now, the app is available only on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's App Store</a> for iPhone and iPad.</p><p>The app debuted quietly in May. Then it took off. It is now the top-paid app on China's Apple App Store and ranks sixth among paid apps in the U.S. The surge reflects a major social shift. More people in China live alone than ever before. One-child policies, rapid urbanization and work that pulls people far from their families all play a role. By 2030, China is projected to have around 200 million one-person households. At that scale, a simple safety check turns from a niche idea into a mass-market tool.</p><p>For many users, the app is not a joke. It is a safety net. One 38-year-old user told reporters he lives far from his family and worries about dying alone in a rented apartment. He set his mother as his emergency contact so someone would know if something happened to him. Others echoed a similar sentiment online. People living alone, introverts, unemployed workers and those dealing with depression said the app offers peace of mind without requiring constant interaction. Some users even reportedly framed it as a practical courtesy to loved ones rather than a morbid tool.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-help-older-relatives-tech-over-holidays" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOW TO HELP OLDER RELATIVES WITH TECH OVER THE HOLIDAYS</strong></a></p><p>Not everyone is comfortable with the app's blunt branding. Some users say the name is too dark and turns people away. Several suggested a simple fix: rename it "Are You Alive?" One commenter argued that death in this context is not only literal but social. A softer name might signal care rather than fear. Some users said they would gladly pay for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the app</a> if it sounded less grim. The developers appear to be listening.</p><p>The app is built by a small Gen Z team at Moonscape Technologies. In public statements, the company said it plans to refine the product based on feedback.</p><p>Planned updates include:</p><p>Those changes matter in a country where about one in five people is now over age 60.</p><p>The app's success abroad suggests the issue is global. In the U.S., living alone is becoming the norm rather than the exception. According to recent census data, 27.6% of U.S. households had just one person in 2020. That figure was under 8% in 1940. Loneliness trends among younger men are especially striking. A Gallup poll found that about one in four Gen Z and millennial men in the U.S. report feeling lonely. That rate is higher than in peer countries like France, Canada, Ireland and Spain. Against that backdrop, an app that asks people to check in feels less extreme and more revealing.</p><p><strong>Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?</strong></p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?

As more people live alone, the worry is not only about loneliness but also about invisibility. A simple tap every two days becomes a quiet signal that someone still knows you are here.
