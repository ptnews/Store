<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dallas Cowboys</a> owner Jerry Jones likened his search for a new defensive coordinator to President Donald Trump’s remarks about "going to run the country" in Venezuela after dictator Nicolás Maduro was captured by the U.S. military last week. </p><p>Jones made the reference during his end-of-year press conference Wednesday, which followed the organization’s decision to fire first-year defensive coordinator <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Eberflus</a> after just one season.   </p><p>Jones was specifically asked by reporters if first-year head coach Brian Schottenheimer would have a say in picking his own defensive coordinator for next season.  </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"Trump just said it. I’m running Venezuela," Jones said, eliciting laughs from the room, including from Schottenheimer.</p><p>Jones clarified that both Schottenheimer and Jones' son, Cowboys CEO Stephen Jones, were heavily involved in the decision to hire Eberflus, and they will be involved in finding his replacement. </p><p>"We’ll make it the same way we’ve made all the calls around here on staff. I wouldn’t make a call if Stephen didn’t agree with the call. … I wouldn’t do that. </p><p>"We’ll do it the same as we hired Flus. We’ll do it together, and come up with as good as we can." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/cowboys-make-changes-coaching-staff-disastrous-defensive-season-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>COWBOYS MAKE CHANGES TO COACHING STAFF AFTER DISASTROUS DEFENSIVE SEASON: REPORTS</u></strong></a></p><p>Trump said after last week’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-venezuela-strike-sparks-constitutional-clash-maduro-hauled-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military strikes in Venezuela</a> that the United States is "going to run the country" in Venezuela until what he described as a safe, proper and judicious transition can take place.</p><p>He framed the role as temporary but necessary, saying the U.S. does not want to allow "somebody else to get in" before conditions are stable. </p><p>"We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition," he said. </p><p>Jones’ strong approach came after the Cowboys were eliminated from the playoffs in Week 16 with the Philadelphia Eagles’ win over the Washington Commanders. Dallas closed out its season with a Week 18 loss to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Giants</a> and the most points allowed and fewest passes intercepted in franchise history.</p><p>"This certainly is an example of what can happen to you in this game of football. You guys have heard me say that a lot of times. It has fleeting moments of euphoria, and those are made special by having hard times," Jones said Wednesday. </p><p>"I am disappointed that we aren't in the playoffs and aren’t in good shape to be in the playoffs. So, that is a disappointment."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report. </i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
