<p>The U.S. Supreme Court left unresolved Tuesday a high-stakes challenge to President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>'s use of an emergency law to impose sweeping tariffs, prolonging uncertainty over a case closely watched by the White House and global markets.</p><p>The high court released three lower-profile opinions: Berk v. Choy, Ellingburg v. United States and Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc. v. Burton.</p><p>All three rulings were unanimous, with separate concurring opinions filed in two of the cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-prepares-confront-monumental-case-trump-executive-power-tariff-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY</strong></a></p><p>In Berk v. Choy, the justices looked at whether a Delaware law requiring medical malpractice plaintiffs to file an "affidavit of merit" applies in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-hands-down-decision-trans-military-ban-suit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal court.</a> The Court unanimously said it does not, ruling that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure control instead and override the state requirement.</p><p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson filed a concurring opinion.</p><p>In Coney Island Auto Parts v. Burton, the case centered on whether a company could challenge a judgment as void years later, or whether it waited too long to do so. The Court unanimously ruled that even claims arguing a judgment is void must be filed within a "reasonable time" under federal rules.</p><p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-tariff-power-grab-barrels-toward-supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP'S TARIFF POWER GRAB BARRELS TOWARD SUPREME COURT</strong></a></p><p>And in Ellingburg v. United States, the justices considered whether court-ordered monetary restitution under a federal law counts as criminal punishment for purposes of the Constitution’s Ex Post Facto Clause. The justices unanimously agreed that it does, meaning restitution is subject to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constitution’s limits</a> on retroactive criminal punishment.</p><p>Anticipation for the Supreme Court tariff ruling is building after Trump threatened on his Truth Social platform to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-announces-escalating-tariffs-denmark-other-european-nations-force-greenland-purchase-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impose a 10% tariff on eight</a> European countries unless a deal is reached for what he called the "complete and total purchase of Greenland."</p><p>Trump has defended the tariffs as a necessary use of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergency authority</a>, while challengers argue the move exceeds presidential power and bypasses Congress.</p><p>The Court has not yet announced when it will next release opinions.</p>
