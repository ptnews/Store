"So, I literally passed out, fell off the wall, and it was like a 12-foot drop, but the water was only three feet deep. I didn't know that at the time. Well, thank God it was three feet deep, because I can't swim." </p><p>He described feeling excruciating pain as he tried to stand up, later learning his fall may have been caused by diabetic ketoacidosis, a complication from high blood sugar levels.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

And, so, with just those three things, the weight just started dropping off tremendously.</p><p>"It wasn't an overnight process," Aaron said. "It definitely took some work, but my mindset was at that point where it was like, ‘I got a lot of things I want to live for.’ At the time, I was single. I've always wanted to be married and have kids. And I'm like, ‘What condition am I gonna be in if I had kids? I gotta make these changes.’"</p><p>"Mike &amp; Molly" star Billy Gardell opened up about his dramatic 170-pound weight loss journey during a December 2025 interview with <a href="https://people.com/former-mike-and-molly-star-billy-gardell-lost-170-lbs-and-transformed-his-life-exclusive-11864191" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>.</p><p>"I was medicating my <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mike-molly-star-calls-food-his-poison-pills-after-dramatic-170-pound-weight-loss-transform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emotions and my fears with food</a>, and I was also celebrating my victories with food," Gardell, told the outlet. "You’re eating to deflect your feelings when they’re bad or enhance them when they’re good, and both of those things are poison pills."</p><p>He added that he "had gotten so big and so stationary that it hurt to stand up."</p><p>Gardell shared that, in 2020, he weighed 370 pounds and, in 2021, felt he had no choice but to undergo bariatric surgery out of "desperation."
