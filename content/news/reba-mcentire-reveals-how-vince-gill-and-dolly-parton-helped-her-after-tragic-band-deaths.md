"Dolly Parton said, 'Here, take my band.' It was such a gift to see how many people stepped forward to help, and to reassure, because so many of us had hearts that were broken."</p><p>Her band and crew members were flying out of San Diego after a concert when their charter jet plane crashed. The singer was not on the plane, and instead was scheduled to leave San Diego the next morning.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/reba-mcentire-calls-out-ai-generated-fake-pregnancy-photos-dolly-parton-deathbed-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>REBA MCENTIRE CALLS OUT AI-GENERATED FAKE PREGNANCY PHOTOS AND DOLLY PARTON 'DEATHBED' IMAGES</strong></a></p><p>The crash claimed the lives of McEntire’s tour manager, Jim Hammon, keyboardist and bandleader Kirk Cappello, keyboardist Joey Cigainero, drummer Tony Saputo, guitarist Michael Thomas, guitarist Chris Austin, bassist Terry Jackson and vocalist Paula Kaye Evans as well as the two pilots, Donald Holmes and Christopher Hollinger.</p><p>"I didn't know if I was going to be able to continue," McEntire told People magazine in October 2022 about the crash.
