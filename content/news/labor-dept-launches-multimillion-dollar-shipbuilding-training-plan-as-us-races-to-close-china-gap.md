<p><strong>FIRST ON FOX: </strong>The Labor Department is distributing nearly $14 million to U.S. institutions as part of a new initiative to train American workers to enter the shipbuilding industry, aligning with President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> push to revamp U.S. shipbuilding. </p><p>The U.S. shipbuilding industry has lagged in comparison to near-peer adversaries like China, but the Labor Department’s new effort seeks to close that gap by creating a program that supports "cutting-edge training programs" crafted in conjunction with U.S. allies to learn shipbuilding trades, according to the Labor Department. </p><p>A total of $8 million in funding will go toward Delaware County Community College, which will partner with Hanwa Philly Shipyard and South Korea, and $5.8 million will go toward the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, which will partner with Finland and Bollinger Shipyards, to offer advanced shipbuilding skill training to U.S. workers. </p><p>Likewise, the initiative aims to establish a specialized, internationally recognized trade curriculum in an attempt to increase apprenticeship programs in the U.S.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-unveils-900b-defense-bill-targeting-china-tech-bans-investment-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CONGRESS UNVEILS $900B DEFENSE BILL TARGETING CHINA WITH TECH BANS, INVESTMENT CRACKDOWN, US TROOP PAY RAISE</strong></a></p><p>"Restoring America’s maritime dominance can’t be accomplished without skilled American workers," Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a Tuesday statement to Fox News Digital. "In line with President Trump’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive orders</a>, these projects will help train our next generation of shipbuilders and ensure the skills critical to revitalizing our shipbuilding industry are developed here at home."</p><p>The U.S. is massively behind near-peer competitors like China when it comes to shipbuilding, as well as allies like South Korea and Japan. </p><p>China is responsible for more than 50% of global shipbuilding, while South Korea is responsible for nearly 29% and Japan 13%, while the rest of the world accounts for roughly 4.4%, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Overall, the U.S. is responsible for just 0.1% of global shipbuilding.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-unveils-golden-fleet-navy-battleships-touts-them-more-powerful-than-any-ship-ever-built" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP UNVEILS ‘GOLDEN FLEET’ OF NAVY BATTLESHIPS, TOUTS THEM AS ‘MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY SHIP EVER BUILT'</strong></a></p><p>"The erosion of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. and allied shipbuilding capabilities</a> poses an urgent threat to military readiness, reduces economic opportunities, and contributes to China’s global power-projection ambitions," the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a March report.</p><p>Meanwhile, Finnish firms design roughly 80% of icebreakers globally, and Finnish shipyards build more than 60% of icebreakers, according to the Wilson Center. </p><p>Trump told lawmakers in March that he would "resurrect" both commercial and military shipbuilding, and signed an executive order in April seeking to reinvigorate the U.S. shipbuilding sector.</p><p>That executive order called for assessments of how the government could enhance financial support through the Defense Production Act, the Department of Defense Office of Strategic Capital, a new Maritime Security Trust Fund, investment from shipbuilders from allied countries, and other grant programs.</p><p>It also ordered agencies to craft a maritime action plan, and instructed the U.S. trade representative to create a list of recommendations to tackle China’s "anticompetitive actions within the shipbuilding industry."</p>
