<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> House GOP critics are ripping the administration's operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of the country's president, Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was the first to criticize the Trump administration's operation in Venezuela, again breaking from the majority of his party and butting heads with the commander-in-chief.</p><p>Massie, a longtime critic of U.S. foreign intervention, appeared to question the legality of the federal government's Venezuela strikes.</p><p>"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn’t be tweeting that they’ve arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law," Massie posted to X on Saturday morning.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-capture-maduro-championed-condemned-across-world-stage-after-surgical-venezuela-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US CAPTURE OF MADURO CHAMPIONED, CONDEMNED ACROSS WORLD STAGE AFTER SURGICAL VENEZUELA STRIKES</strong></a></p><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a four-count indictment against Maduro after Trump confirmed the U.S. took custody of the Venezuelan leader and his wife following <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/explosions-venezuelan-capital-caracas-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strikes in the capital</a> of Caracas.</p><p>Attorney General <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pam-bondi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pam Bondi</a> said in a statement those charges were "Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States."</p><p>It's not immediately clear what Maduro's wife, Celia Flores, has been charged with.</p><p>In a follow-up posted on the charges, Massie said, "25-page indictment but no mention of fentanyl or stolen oil. Search it for yourself."</p><p>Trump said on Fox News that Maduro and Flores were being flown to the U.S.S. Iwo Jima, which will bring them to the U.S. where they will face criminal proceedings led by the Southern District of New York.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massie's criticism</a> was followed by scathing comments by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., another Trump critic who is retiring from Congress early next week before finishing her term.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-casts-maduros-ouster-smart-move-russia-china-enter-fray" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP CASTS MADURO’S OUSTER AS ‘SMART’ MOVE AS RUSSIA, CHINA ENTER THE FRAY</strong></a></p><p>"If U.S. military action and regime change in Venezuela was really about saving American lives from deadly drugs, then why hasn’t the Trump admin taken action against Mexican cartels? And if prosecuting narco terrorists is a high priority, then why did President Trump pardon the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted and sentenced for 45 years for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into America?" part of Greene's statement read.</p><p>"The next obvious observation is that by removing Maduro this is a clear move for control over <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuelan oil supplies</a> that will ensure stability for the next obvious regime change war in Iran. And of course, why is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader, but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I’m not endorsing Russia or China)."</p><p>Meanwhile, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., praised the operation itself but expressed concerns about what precedent is being set.</p><p>"My main concern now is that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia will use this</a> to justify their illegal and barbaric military actions against Ukraine, or China to justify an invasion of Taiwan," Bacon said in a statement. "Freedom and rule of law were defended last night, but dictators will try to exploit this to rationalize their selfish objectives."</p><p>Bacon is also retiring from Congress, but unlike Greene, he is serving out his full term.</p><p>The vast majority of Republican lawmakers unequivocally backed the operation, as expected. </p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., both said they expected congressional briefings from the Trump administration in the coming days when lawmakers return from a two-week recess. </p>
