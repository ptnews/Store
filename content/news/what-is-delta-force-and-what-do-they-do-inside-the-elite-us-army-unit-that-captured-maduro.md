The unit has previously been involved in some of the most consequential U.S. military operations, including the 2003 capture of Saddam Hussein. The secretive unit also conducted numerous counterterrorism missions in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East, targeting senior al-Qaeda figures.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/from-bus-driver-dictator-nicolas-maduros-rise-fall-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FROM BUS DRIVER TO DICTATOR: NICOLÁS MADURO’S RISE AND FALL IN VENEZUELA</strong></a></p><p>Delta Force is commanded by a senior Army officer, but the identity of the unit’s leader is also kept classified, as is the exact size of the unit. </p><p>It is unclear how many members took part in the Venezuela operation.</p><p>During the raid, U.S. Army helicopters from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the "Night Stalkers," flew the special operations forces into Venezuela, officials said.</p><p>At least <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/explosions-venezuelan-capital-caracas-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven explosions were heard</a> in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, and low-flying aircraft were seen over the city at about 2 a.m. local time, according to reports.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/cia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CIA</a> provided intelligence to the Department of War that helped guide Delta Force to Maduro and his wife, whom President Donald Trump said were apprehended during the U.S. military operation.</p><p>Officials emphasized that while the CIA played a critical role in tracking and locating Maduro, U.S. military special operations forces carried out the physical capture.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/maria-corina-machado-emerges-top-potential-successor-after-maduros-fall" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MARIA CORINA MACHADO EMERGES AS TOP POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR AFTER MADURO’S FALL</strong></a></p><p>Trump told "FOX &amp; Friends Weekend" early Saturday that U.S. military personnel involved in the operation "did an incredible job."</p><p>"They rehearsed and practiced like nobody’s ever seen," Trump said.

"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation."</p><p>"They just broke in and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into," he added. "I’ve never seen anything like it."</p><p>Trump said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maduro was inside a fortified residence</a> but was captured before he could reach a secure area.</p><p>Trump also said there were injuries during the operation but no U.S. fatalities and no aircraft losses.</p><p>Maduro and his wife were taken aboard the USS Iwo Jima and are expected to be transported to the United States, where they could appear in federal court in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City</a> as soon as Monday, Fox News has learned.</p><p><i>Fox News’ Rachel Wolf, David Spunt, Jennifer Griffin and Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.</i></p>
