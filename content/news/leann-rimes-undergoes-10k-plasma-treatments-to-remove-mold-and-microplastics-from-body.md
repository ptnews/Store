"Therapeutic Plasma Exchange, also known as TPE or plasmapheresis ('plasma-fur-ee-sis'), is a medical treatment that removes the liquid portion of blood, known as plasma, which contains proteins, antibodies, toxins, inflammatory agents, and other substances, and replaces it with fresh albumin." </p><p>The procedure costs $10,000, and is designed to "remove plasma from your blood to eliminate inflammatory proteins, toxins, and cellular waste, then replace it with sterile albumin to replenish essential nutrients," according to Next Health.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Think of it like an ‘oil change for your body.’"</p><p>Last summer, Rimes suddenly walked offstage during a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/washington" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concert in Washington</a>, and revealed the following day that her teeth had fallen out. </p><p>"This is the most epic example of how the show must go on," Rimes said online. "Last night, I was onstage in the middle of ‘One Way Ticket’ and I felt something pop in my mouth."</p><p>"If you’ve been around, you know that I’ve had a lot of dental surgeries, and I have a bridge in front, and it fell out in the middle of my song last night." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Rimes said she instantly panicked and popped her bridge back in before returning to her performance. </p><p>"For the rest of the show… I was literally, like this, pushing my teeth in, like, every couple of lines," she said. "Like ‘Can’t Fight the Moonlight,' they completely fell again in my mouth. It was the most epic experience ever."</p><p>Rimes has a long history of dental issues and has had 29 surgeries, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/country/leann-rimes-teeth-fell-out-show-1236007850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Billboard.</a> The outlet reported that Rimes sued her former dentist for malpractice in 2013, claiming that she suffered from chronic pain and medical complications after getting veneers. </p>
