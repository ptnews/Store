<p>Adults who consider themselves "night owls" tend to score lower in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardiovascular health</a> assessments and face a higher risk of heart attack or stroke.</p><p>That’s according to a new study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, which examined how a person’s chronotype — their natural tendency to be active in the morning or evening — is linked to overall heart health.</p><p>The researchers looked at 14 years of UK Biobank data for around 300,000 adults averaging 57 years old, according to a press release for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the study</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/easy-nutrition-tweak-could-transform-sleep-starting-this-evening" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EASY NUTRITION TWEAK COULD TRANSFORM YOUR SLEEP — STARTING THIS EVENING</strong></a></p><p>Around 8% of the participants described themselves as "definitely evening people," which means they stayed up very late. Another 24% said they were "definitely morning people," as they tended to wake up earlier and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go to bed earlier</a>.</p><p>The largest "intermediate" group, which included 67% of participants, said they were unsure or in neither group.</p><p>Each person’s heart health was determined using the American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 score.</p><p>"Life’s Essential 8 is a comprehensive assessment that includes activity levels, diet, blood pressure, cholesterol, use of nicotine, sleep patterns, weight management and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood sugar</a>," shared Dr. Bradley Serwer, an interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an Ingenovis Health company.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/men-beer-bellies-may-face-serious-heart-damage-even-normal-weight" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MEN WITH 'BEER BELLIES' MAY FACE SERIOUS HEART DAMAGE REGARDLESS OF WEIGHT</strong></a></p><p>The researchers also looked at incidence of heart attack <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or stroke</a> over the follow-up period.</p><p>They determined that people who were more active in the evening ("night owls") had a 79% higher risk of poor cardiovascular health compared to the intermediate group, and a 16% higher risk of heart attack or stroke, the release stated.</p><p>People who identified as being more active in the morning had slightly better heart health scores. The link was more pronounced in women than men.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>"'Evening people' often experience <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circadian misalignment</a>, meaning their internal body clock may not match the natural day-to-night light cycle or their typical daily schedules," said lead study author Sina Kianersi, Ph.D., a research fellow in the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston, in the release.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</strong></a></p><p>"Evening people may be more likely to have behaviors that can affect cardiovascular health, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poorer diet quality</a>, smoking, and inadequate or irregular sleep."</p><p>Serwer, who was not involved in the study, noted that lifestyle habits played a significant role in these findings.</p><p>"Cardiovascular disease has multiple contributing causes," the Maryland-based cardiologist told Fox News Digital. "Sleep is just one variable — and the importance of high-quality, restorative sleep should not be undervalued."</p><p>The findings could help doctors tailor lifestyle and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical interventions</a> to help prevent cardiovascular events, the researchers noted.</p><p>The study did have some limitations, chiefly that it does not prove that staying up late causes heart problems, but only establishes an association.</p><p>Also, the study relied on people reporting their own schedules, habits and health, which could be skewed.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>Finally, the people included in the UK Biobank are <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primarily White</a> and tend to have better health than the general population, the researchers noted, which means the results may not be widely generalized.</p><p>Serwer added, "While quality sleep is important, further studies are required to show exactly what sort of impact sleep alone has on cardiovascular health."</p>
