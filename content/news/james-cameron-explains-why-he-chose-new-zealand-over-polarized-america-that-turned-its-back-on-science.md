<p>Filmmaker James Cameron said in a new interview that the U.S. rejection of science and vaccines out of the COVID-19 pandemic drove him to move to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/new-zealand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Zealand</a>.</p><p>In an interview on the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E_7MunXcBY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">In Depth with Graham Bensinger</a>" podcast, Cameron discussed his reason for relocating permanently to New Zealand, where he both lives and spent years working on the "Avatar" movies.</p><p>Bensinger noted that the United States is "a fantastic place to live," prompting Cameron to ask, "Is it?"</p><p>"But New Zealand is just stunningly beautiful," Bensinger said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/director-judd-apatow-claims-were-dictatorship-now-during-golden-globes-remarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DIRECTOR JUDD APATOW CLAIMS ‘WE’RE IN A DICTATORSHIP NOW’ DURING GOLDEN GLOBES REMARKS</strong></a></p><p>"I’m not there for scenery, I’m there for the sanity," Cameron replied. </p><p>Cameron said that the U.S.'s handling of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coronavirus</a> pandemic revealed that many were skeptical of science and lacked unity in a common cause.</p><p>"After the pandemic hit… [New Zealand] had eliminated the virus completely," Cameron said. "They actually eliminated the virus twice. The third time, when it showed up in a mutated form, it broke through. But fortunately, they already had a 98% vaccination rate. This is why I love New Zealand. People there are, for the most part, sane as opposed to the United States, where you had a 62% vaccination rate, and that’s going down – going the wrong direction."</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic struck the world during President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>’s first term in office in 2020, leading to millions of deaths, including more than one million in the U.S.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/al-gore-sounds-climate-crisis-alarm-trump-yanks-us-from-un-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AL GORE SOUNDS 'CLIMATE CRISIS' ALARM AS TRUMP YANKS US FROM UN INITIATIVES</strong></a></p><p>"Are you kidding me? Where would you rather live?" Cameron said. "A place that actually believes in science and is sane and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody’s at each other’s throats, extremely polarized, turning its back on science and basically would be in utter disarray if another pandemic appears."</p><p>Cameron did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <a href="https://foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a>. </p><p>Cameron, best known for directing movies like "The Terminator," "Titanic," and "Avatar," has been a frequent Trump critic.</p><p>The Oscar-winning director had recently criticized the Trump administration’s decision to roll back environmental protections, calling the commander-in-chief the "most narcissistic a------ in history since f------ Nero." He argued the White House is helping to send the human race "backwards." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-cameron-says-fundamental-issue-putting-guardrails-ai-humans-cant-agree-morals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>JAMES CAMERON SAYS THE 'FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE' WITH PUTTING GUARDRAILS ON AI IS THAT HUMANS CAN'T AGREE ON MORALS</u></strong></a></p><p>Furthermore, Cameron <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-cameron-calls-trump-election-horrifying-he-complains-about-not-being-able-escape-him" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>told New Zealand outlet Stuff</u></a> in January that he found the president’s re-election "horrifying." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p>
