<p>A Texas man unearthed an unexpected treasure during a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/family-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">family trip</a> this winter — all thanks to his sons and his wife's Siri search.</p><p>Arkansas State Parks recently shared news about the find, which was made at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Pike County. Forty-one-year-old James Ward unearthed the 2.09-carat brown diamond on Dec. 30.</p><p>Ward, who lives in Cypress, Texas, was visiting the park with his wife, Elizabeth, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their two young sons</a>, Adrian, 9, and Austin, 7.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/long-lost-ancient-village-mysterious-past-unearthed-during-wind-farm-dig-exciting-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LONG-LOST ANCIENT VILLAGE WITH MYSTERIOUS PAST UNEARTHED AMID WIND FARM DIG: 'EXCITING DISCOVERY'</u></strong></a></p><p>Visiting the park was the 7-year-old's idea, according to Elizabeth Ward. </p><p>"One day we were watching TV, and Austin came and said, ‘Mommy, Mommy, is there any place in Texas or nearby that we can <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mine for crystals?</a>’" the mother recalled.</p><p>She quickly searched with Siri and found information on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/great-outdoors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crater of Diamonds State Park</a>.</p><p>"I sent the link to James, and he’s like, ‘Oh wait, that’s only like six hours away. We can go!’" added Elizabeth Ward.</p><p>The gem, named the Ward Diamond, was found on the family's second day of searching. </p><p>The first day was long and cold, but 9-year-old Adrian encouraged the family to come back the next day — when the gem was found.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew it was different than everything else I had found," said the dad. </p><p>Waymon Cox, an assistant park superintendent, compared the diamond to a corn kernel.</p><p>"[It has] a dark yellowish-brown hue and a beautiful, metallic luster [that's] characteristic of all Crater diamonds," said Cox.</p><p>He added that crater diamonds formed in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earth's upper mantle</a> — and "were carried to the surface by an ancient volcanic pipe" millions of years ago.</p><p>"Most are chipped, broken or include flaws from the immense geological forces they endured," Cox said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Given its current size, you can imagine how much bigger Mr. Ward’s diamond might have been as a complete crystal." </p><p>What lies ahead for the diamond is unknown — and Ward said he's open to selling it or keeping it.</p><p>"I’ll have to see how much it’s worth first," he said. </p><p>Ward also encouraged fellow park visitors not to give up on their first day of digging.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"Listen to your kids about their dreams and what they want to do!" his wife added. </p><p>Arkansas State Parks told Fox News Digital that park employees "are not trained to grade or appraise diamonds or other rocks and minerals."</p><p>"Our primary training involves properly identifying and registering diamonds for guests who find them," the official said. </p><p>"Anyone interested in having their diamonds graded or appraised can reach out to a certified gemologist, who has had special training to properly grade <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/discover-luxury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gemstone quality</a> and estimate value."</p><p>Ward's discovery adds to a growing list of substantial gems found by visitors at Crater of Diamonds State Park.</p><p>An Oklahoma family unearthed a 2.79-carat diamond at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/oklahoma-family-uncovers-really-neat-diamond-state-park-thanks-dollar-store-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crater of Diamonds State Park</a> back in September, thanks to tools they bought at a dollar store.</p><p>In April, a Minnesota resident unearthed a stunning 3.81-carat <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/man-finds-candy-like-diamond-while-exploring-arkansas-state-park-chance-lifetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brown diamond</a> at the park — a find that he compared to a candy wrapper.</p>
