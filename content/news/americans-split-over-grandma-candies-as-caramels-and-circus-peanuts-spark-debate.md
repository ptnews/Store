<p>From strawberry bonbons wrapped in crinkly red foil to neon-orange circus peanuts and Werther's Originals pulled from a purse, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-traditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"grandma candy"</a> is sparking nostalgia and debate online.</p><p>Thousands of people have shared memories, jokes and strong opinions about their grandmothers' go-to sweets across social media and Reddit, including a Facebook post from <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/grandma-candy-11878274" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Southern Living</a> that triggered recollections of red-and-white Starlight mints and ribbon candy "all stuck together." </p><p>One that nearly everyone says they recognize instantly is the strawberry bonbon, a hard candy wrapped like a strawberry and filled with sticky syrup.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/retro-refined-jell-o-salad-savory-gelatin-dishes-make-unexpected-return" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FROM RETRO TO REFINED: JELL-O SALAD AND SAVORY GELATIN DISHES MAKE UNEXPECTED RETURN</strong></a></p><p>"It's all about the goo," many people agreed in a recent thread on Reddit.</p><p>Not everyone is convinced the candy holds up today, including Brian Francis, a Canadian novelist and food writer who once tried and ranked <a href="https://www.brian-francis.com/blog/2019/8/5/granny-candy-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">20 different granny candies,</a> even logging how long it took to suck on them. (Sour Lemon Drops took the longest, clocking in at 10 minutes and 13 seconds of "suckability.")</p><p>The strawberry sweets "tasted like lip gloss" to him, while other people remembered them as "tooth breakers."</p><p>"For me, the worst are the chewy candies, the kind that stick to your teeth for days afterward like epoxy," Francis told Fox News Digital.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/7-retro-salad-dressings-once-ruled-americas-fridges-making-comeback" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>7 RETRO SALAD DRESSINGS THAT ONCE RULED AMERICA'S FRIDGES ARE MAKING A COMEBACK</strong></a></p><p>The strawberry bonbons were hardly the most <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/snack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polarizing candy</a> discussed. </p><p>Circus peanuts — the banana-flavored, neon-orange marshmallow treats — sparked just as much passion and mockery.</p><p>"[I don't care] what [anybody] says, circus peanuts are the best," one Redditor wrote.</p><p>Another joked, "My wife and kids make fun of me for liking circus peanuts and black licorice … More for me."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/whatever-happened-olive-loaf-nostalgic-1970s-deli-meat-america-abandoned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHATEVER HAPPENED TO OLIVE LOAF, THE NOSTALGIC 1970S DELI MEAT THAT AMERICA ABANDONED?</strong></a></p><p>Some people even argued the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squishy orange candy,</a> which still graces some supermarket aisles, improves with age. "First thing I do is tear a hole open and let them sit a few days," one commenter said. "That's the way."</p><p>Among the few candies that drew near-universal approval were Werther's Originals — the caramel hard candies commonly found in purses and coat pockets.</p><p>"I scrolled until I found Werther's!!! So good," one Reddit user wrote. </p><p>Another added, "There's always a Werther's in the pocketbook or dish."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Francis agreed that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classic caramels</a> are among the sweets that still hold up. He recommends warming the cubes up slightly before eating. </p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Werther's Original for comment.</p><p>Butter mints also inspired strong affection, with many admitting the candies are difficult to stop eating once opened.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</strong></a></p><p>"This is one of those things that's not safe for me to buy because I will just mindlessly and compulsively eat them all," one user wrote. </p><p>Another recalled, "At one point I ate so many I couldn't taste anything for a week."</p><p>Francis argued in his blog post that the butter mints created a "sticky mess," while wintergreen mints just tasted "old" to him, "like dusty curtains and yellowed bedsheets."</p><p>"I'd say licorice toffee is at the bottom, but sugared spearmint leaves are close behind," he added. "They should only ever be used as gingerbread house decorations."</p><p>Jelly orange slices, meanwhile, emerged as another favorite. They were frequently mentioned without controversy.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>"Ooooh!! Orange slices!!! YASS!!" one Reddit user wrote.</p><p>Another person admitted, "I could easily finish off a bag in one sitting. Now <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my stomach hurts</a> just thinking about it."</p><p>Beyond bellyaches, the old-fashioned candies are also linked to childhood mischief for many. </p><p>"One of my earliest memories was going upstairs into my grandma's bedroom to steal one of these," one user recalled.</p><p>"Many of us have fond memories of visiting a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grandparent or an elderly relative</a> and seeing that elaborate crystal candy dish filled to the brim," Francis agreed. </p><p>"I was always sticking in my hand to grab a fistful when backs were turned."</p><p>For others, the candies symbolize a bygone era.</p><p>"Grandma candies also seem to evoke simpler times — when people popped a butterscotch candy into their mouths while sitting on porches and waving at neighbors," Francis said.</p>
