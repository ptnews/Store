<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-yankees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Yankees</a> are running it back, and not many fans are happy about it.</p><p>Sure, it doesn't seem like a bad idea to keep a large majority of a 94-win team that only lost the division due to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head-to-head tiebreaker</a>.</p><p>However, the Yankees' title drought reached 16 seasons after getting embarrassed by the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Division Series, and calls for change were louder than ever.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>Those changes, though, did not come.</p><p>The Yankees added just one person to their 40-man roster in left-handed pitcher Ryan Weathers, while <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/devin-williams-mets-agree-3-year-deal-after-tumultuous-season-yankees-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relievers Devin Williams and Luke Weaver</a> went to their crosstown rival, the New York Mets. Everything else is all the same.</p><p>For Yankees legend Derek Jeter, though, it's all about getting hot at the right time.</p><p>"It’s a long season. I used to say it when I played – and people got tired of me saying it – the best teams make it to the postseason, and the hottest team wins. Teams that get there, whoever’s hottest can win a World Series," Jeter said to Fox News Digital in a recent interview. "They had a successful regular season, didn’t end up how they wanted to, but I’m sure things change. Trade deadline, injuries, a lot of things happen. So they obviously like the position they’re in, and we’ll see what happens."</p><p>Does he like the position they're in?</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/sports/derek-jeter-returns-captain-fast-growing-racquet-sport-padels-reserve-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEREK JETER TAKES ON CAPTAIN ROLE FOR PADEL TEAM AT MIAMI’S RESERVE CUP</strong></a></p><p>"It all comes down to the trade deadline, man. Teams change dramatically at the trade deadline," Jeter added.</p><p>With the back-to-back World Series champion <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> breaking payroll records and adding Edwin Diaz and Kyle Tucker, Hal Steinbrenner has been public enemy No. 1 in the Bronx, but Jeter came to his defense, as he did some years ago when Steinbrenner was booed by the Yankee fan base, and Jeter urged them to cheer.</p><p>"Yankee fans, they have high expectations. They’ve always had high expectations. For them, if you don’t win the World Series, it’s a failure. In that sense, I have the same mindset. So I get the frustration," Jeter said. "But I'm sure Hal is frustrated as well. Hal’s been willing to go out and get players and put the Yankees in a position to win. But ultimately, you have to go out on the field and perform."</p><p>Ironically enough, the Yankees went 32-12 in their final 44 games, including winning each of their last eight. So being the hottest team did not work out for the Yankees.</p><p>In any case, it would be a surprise to see the Yankees not play October baseball — but it has not been surprising to see failures that month.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
