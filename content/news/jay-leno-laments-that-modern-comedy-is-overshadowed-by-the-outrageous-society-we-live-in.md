<p>Comedian and late-night legend Jay Leno said in an interview Saturday that modern comedy has been eclipsed by the "outrageous" society we live in, particularly in the era of President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>.</p><p>"You know, people always say, ‘Oh, and I bet you missed it with Trump being president.’ No, not really. It’s like shooting fish in a barrel," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h361wQC3E4M" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leno told Maria Shriver</a> on her "Life Above the Noise<strong>" </strong>podcast. "You know, you kind of do it, psychologists used to say the punchline of the joke would be like 'that’s like the president with a stripper.' OK, now the president is with strippers."</p><p>Shriver had asked the comedian if he envied <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/late-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today's late-night scene</a> or if he was glad he wasn't part of it.</p><p>"I mean, you can’t — we live in a society where there’s nothing you can say that’s so outrageous, because <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/comedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comedy comes from a place</a> of conservatism. You start with a sort of moral high ground," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jim-gaffigan-says-comedy-audiences-tired-political-drama-just-want-laugh-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JIM GAFFIGAN SAYS COMEDY AUDIENCES ARE TIRED OF POLITICAL DRAMA AND JUST WANT TO LAUGH AGAIN</strong></a></p><p>Leno told an anecdote about performing at a prison to make his point.</p><p>"I had an act about meeting women. You know, I said, you know how when you see a girl, you’re not quite sure how to approach her. And this guy yells out, ‘Just punch her in the face and f--- her,’ and they all cheer. And I go, ‘OK, I’m playing a prison.’ The idea of approaching and being, it just made me laugh because the cultural mores in the prison really are not the same ones I’m dealing with here," Leno said.</p><p>Shriver said it was like what used to be off-limits is now real, and what was shocking is now "everyday."</p><p>"That’s why it’s fun to go the other way," Leno replied. "I just like to work clean just because it requires a bit more thought, and it makes it a bit trickier."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jay-leno-wife-mavis-rely-faith-family-to-overcome-lifes-hardships-gets-easier" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>JAY LENO, WIFE MAVIS RELY ON FAITH, FAMILY TO OVERCOME LIFE'S HARDSHIPS</u></strong></a></p><p>He said it was harder to work with clean material because you need to please every audience member.</p><p>"We live in a society now where people just whatever you’re into, there’s an audience for that. And you just play that audience," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/leno-says-tickets-sales-up-after-removed-politics-from-stand-up-says-nobody-wants-lectured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leno said during a November interview</a> that he completely cut politics out of his stand-up act.</p><p>The veteran comic told NBC’s "Today" that his ticket sales have gone up since the change because he’s not alienating a third of his audience with political jokes. </p><p>"I'm on the road a lot. I just took politics out of it, completely. I know ticket sales are up 20, 30%, just because nobody wants to be lectured," Leno told co-host Hoda Kotb.</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</strong></a></p><p>The former host of NBC’s "The Tonight Show" said comics can take political risks <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6385356642112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on their own programs</a>, but when touring across the country — especially in red states — they often tone it down.</p>
