<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/phil-collins-shuts-down-rumors-hospice-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phil Collins</a> says years of health setbacks have left him dependent on round-the-clock medical care.</p><p>The musician says he’s now under 24-hour care after a brutal stretch of health crises that included <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>five knee surgeries</u></a>, kidney problems and a long hospital stay.</p><p>"It’s an ongoing thing," Collins told BBC Two’s Zoe Ball in a new interview, per <a href="https://variety.com/2026/music/news/phil-collins-health-issues-knee-surgeries-kidney-problems-1236637084/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Variety</a>. "I have a 24-hour live-in nurse to make sure I take my medication as I should do. I’ve had challenges with my knee — I had everything that could go wrong with me, did go wrong with me … I mean, I got COVID in [the] hospital, my kidneys started to back up … everything that [started], that could [have] all seemed to sort of converge at the same time."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/phil-collins-isnt-hungry-make-new-music-while-hes-very-sick" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PHIL COLLINS ISN'T 'HUNGRY' TO MAKE NEW MUSIC WHILE HE'S 'VERY SICK'</u></strong></a></p><p>The remarks come as part of "Phil Collins Eras: In Conversation," <a href="https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/m002qgkz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a five-part BBC Two series</a> that wraps on Jan. 26 and gives a glimpse into why the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer walked away from touring after Genesis’ farewell run in 2022.</p><p>The Grammy-winning musician explained that his knee problems alone required repeated surgeries before he was finally able to regain some mobility.</p><p>"I’ve had five operations on my knee. Now I’ve got a knee that works and I can walk, albeit with assistance — crutches or whatever," he said.</p><p>In 2007, Collins suffered a spinal injury, which resulted in severe nerve damage. His health battles continued to pile on after a back operation left him with drop foot, a condition that significantly impairs walking and ultimately ended his ability to play the drums.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

He recently marked two years of sobriety.</p><p>"I’d probably been drinking too much, and so my kidneys were messed up … I mean, I enjoyed coming off tour, coming off the road, but I thought, ‘Right, I’m going to do all those things that I couldn’t do,’" he said.</p><p>The singer explained that while he didn't drink "all night" or to the point of getting drunk, the effects still eventually took a toll on his body.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/phil-collins-remains-seated-berlin-concert-drums" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PHIL COLLINS REMAINS SEATED DURING BERLIN CONCERT MONTHS AFTER REVEALING HE CAN NO LONGER PLAY THE DRUMS</u></strong></a></p><p>"I stopped drinking at six o’clock in the evening. I wasn’t one of those guys that sort of stayed up all night drinking — I’d drink during the day, but I guess I had too much of it. I was never drunk, although I fell over a couple of times. But it is just one of those things that happened, and it all caught up with me, and I spent months in hospital."</p><p>Collins has also been battling with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>type 2 diabetes</u></a>, in addition to his other health conditions.</p><p>"It’s just been a difficult, interesting, frustrating last few years.

Any suggestion that he was in hospice was described as "completely incorrect."</p><p>The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer’s last album of original material was 2002’s "Testify." He released a Motown covers album, "Going Back," in 2010.</p><p>Collins joined Genesis in 1970 when the band was led by Peter Gabriel, later stepping into the role of frontman after Gabriel’s departure in 1975.</p>
