<p>Archaeologists recently uncovered a surprising 1,400-year-old skull in an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ancient village</a> in Mexico — unusual for both its flat top and cube-like shape.</p><p>Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) announced the find. Officials said the skull was found in the Balcón de Montezuma Archaeological Zone, in the Northern Huasteca region of Tamaulipas.</p><p>The skull belonged to a man who lived between 400 and 900 A.D. He was over 40 years old when he died, officials said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/faces-ancient-mummies-hidden-centuries-revealed-digital-reconstructions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FACES OF ANCIENT MUMMIES, HIDDEN FOR CENTURIES, FINALLY REVEALED THROUGH DIGITAL RECONSTRUCTIONS</strong></a></p><p>The man had a peculiar tabular erect-type skull — with the front and back of the head purposely flattened.</p><p>The skull also has an unusually flat top, giving it a cube-like shape, similar to the rare tabular superior form.</p><p>"As a result, not only was intentional <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cranial deformation</a> identified for the first time at this type of site, but also a variant of cranial modeling not previously reported in this region of Mesoamerica," the INAH press release said. </p><p>In a translated written statement to Fox News Digital, INAH researchers said they believe the skull may have had meaning related to identity and status.</p><p>"Not all individuals at the site (for whom we have complete skeletons) show this kind of cultural modification," the researchers said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"In other words, this individual clearly stood out from others, which gave him a differentiated position."</p><p>The man's position was not "necessarily a high social status" — and the experts suggested he may have held a shaman-like role within the group.</p><p>Though cranial deformations were not unheard of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Mesoamerica,</a> researchers stressed that this type is less common than other types in the region — and unusually combines both tabular erect and tabular superior styles.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"The differences among them lie in the lateral projection angle between the frontal, occipital and/or coronal bones," the team said.</p><p>The team also said the grave was unusual for its small circular shell beads, which served as personal adornments.</p><p>"This new discovery provides highly relevant data on the nature of intercultural relationships in the Huasteca region — especially with the North and the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico," the researchers added. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"It not only shows the high degree of ethnic diversity, but also provides insights into the physical characteristics of its inhabitants."</p><p>The discovery is only one of many archaeological finds that were uncovered in 2025.</p><p>In El Salvador, excavators found <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/archaeologists-uncover-creepy-puppets-odd-location-this-thing-almost-moved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"creepy" puppets</a> at the top of a pyramid that dated back over 2,400 years.</p><p>This summer, a Texas couple unearthed the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/texas-husband-wife-team-finds-priceless-royal-tomb-filled-1700-year-old-treasures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ancient tomb</a> of a legendary king in Caracol, Belize, a major Mayan city established in the 300s A.D.</p>
