Darnold threw for 124 yards and one touchdown, while Seattle's running game took care of most of the offense. </p><p>Running back Kenneth Walker III had 116 rushing yards with three touchdowns. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p><p>San Francisco quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/brock-purdy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brock Purdy</a> had 140 passing yards with no touchdowns and one interception, as he was never able to get the 49ers offense into the end zone, only managing two field goal drives. </p><p>Seattle will now await the winner of Sunday's other NFC divisional round game between the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/chicago-bears" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago Bears</a> and Los Angeles Rams to see who their opponent will be. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fox-super-6-contest-chris-the-bear-fallicas-nfl-divisional-round-predictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FOX SUPER 6 CONTEST: CHRIS 'THE BEAR' FALLICA'S NFL DIVISIONAL ROUND PREDICTIONS</u></strong></a></p><p>Seattle hasn't been back to the NFC Championship since 2014, when they sought to defend their Super Bowl title, beating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/aaron-rodgers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron Rodgers</a> and the Green Bay Packers at home in that game, but then falling short to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.</p><p>Darnold will be looking to put an exclamation point on a dramatic resurgence after a slow start to his pro career with the New York Jets.
