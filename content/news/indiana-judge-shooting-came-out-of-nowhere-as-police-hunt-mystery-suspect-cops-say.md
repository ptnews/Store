Shortly after moving in, a neighbor noticed Grace struggled with feeding herself and completing basic household chores.  </p><p>In September 2019, the Barnetts were charged with multiple counts of neglecting a dependent, due to Grace's disability.</p><p>During Michael Barnett’s trial, Judge Meyer ordered that Grace could only be referred to as an adult, pointing to the court’s previous ruling regarding her birth year, <a href="https://www.purdueexponent.org/city_state/kristine-barnett-dismissed-of-all-charges/article_0d9ab7fe-ca74-11ed-8e54-0b27c782092b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>according to</u></a> The Exponent.

"As you work to peacefully resolve more than 1 million cases a year, you must not only feel safe, you must also be safe. Any violence against a judge or a judge's family is completely unacceptable. As public servants, you are dedicated to the rule of law." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/judge-wife-shot-broad-daylight-indiana-sparking-massive-multi-agency-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JUDGE AND WIFE SHOT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN INDIANA, SPARKING MASSIVE MULTI-AGENCY INVESTIGATION</strong></a></p><p>Additionally, Kimberly Meyer spoke out through police to thank local officials for their involvement in the case. </p><p>"I have great confidence in the Lafayette Police Department’s investigation and want to thank all the agencies involved for their work," she said, in part.
