The targeted districts are in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington.</p><p>"In the same week that the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on the future of Title IX, OCR is aggressively pursuing allegations of discrimination against women and girls by entities which reportedly allow males to compete in women’s sports," Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kimberly Richey said in a news release.</p><p>"Time and again, the Trump administration has made its position clear: Violations of women’s rights, dignity, and fairness are unacceptable.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"We will leave no stone unturned in these investigations to uphold women’s right to equal access in education programs, a fight that started over half a century ago and is far from finished."</p><p>The schools under investigation included the following:</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to each school and district.</p><p>The districts are accused of maintaining "policies or practices that discriminate on the basis of sex by permitting students to participate in sports based on their 'gender identity,' not biological sex," the Education Department said. "These policies jeopardize both the safety and the equal opportunities of women in educational programs and activities."</p><p>Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District responded to a request for comment.</p><p>"The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District has been notified of a review by the U.S. Department of Education," a school official said.
