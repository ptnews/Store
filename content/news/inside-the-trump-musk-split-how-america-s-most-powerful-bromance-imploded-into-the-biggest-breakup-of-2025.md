"This massive, outrageous, pork-filled <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congressional spending bill</a> is a disgusting abomination.

It's good with Elon. I like Elon. I have always liked Elon. Elon's good," Trump said.</p><p>When asked if he had spoken to Musk since Kirk's memorial, Trump said the two have spoken "on and off, a little bit, very little, nothing much."</p><p>"Look, he's a nice guy, and he's a very capable guy. I have always liked him. He had a bad spell. He had a bad period. He had a bad moment. Stupid moment in his life. Very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that, but I like Elon, and I suspect I will always like him," Trump added.</p><p>On Nov. 18, Musk attended a White House dinner as Trump hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. </p><p>The dust seemed to settle on Trump and Musk's "big, beautiful" breakup as 2025 came to a close. </p><p>FOX Business’ Edward Lawrence asked Trump during a cabinet meeting on Dec. 2 whether Musk was "back in [his] circle of friends" after their falling-out.</p><p><i>"</i>Well, I really don't know.
