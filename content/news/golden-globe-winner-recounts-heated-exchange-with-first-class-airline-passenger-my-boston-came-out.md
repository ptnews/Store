<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/golden-globes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden Globe winner</a> Amy Poehler recently shared a story about getting into a heated argument with a fellow passenger during a flight — and an etiquette expert weighed in with thoughts about the risks for travelers in such cramped, confined spaces. </p><p>The actress and comedian discussed the incident on a recent episode of her podcast, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-hang-with-amy-poehler/id1795483480" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"Good Hang,"</a> in which she was joined by "Mean Girls" costar Ana Gasteyer. Poehler's "Good Hang" podcast recently took home the first-ever Golden Globe for Best Podcast. </p><p>The confrontation happened, Gasteyer said, while the two were traveling together around the time they were filming the 2004 comedy — noting that Gasteyer's then-infant daughter Frances was also on the plane with them.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/kelly-ripa-thought-naked-flying-meant-something-else-before-she-learned-truth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KELLY RIPA THOUGHT 'NAKED FLYING' MEANT SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE SHE LEARNED THE TRUTH</strong></a></p><p>"You got into a fight with a guy," Gasteyer recalled on the podcast. </p><p>"Baby Frances was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the plane with us</a>," she added. "Do you remember that?"</p><p>Poehler replied, "And I still got into a fight with the guy with the baby around?"</p><p>Gasteyer recalled that a fellow first-class passenger took issue with Poehler’s foul language, objecting to her loud cursing in front of the baby.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/flight-anxiety-eased-one-simple-mental-trick-says-author-podcast-host-mel-robbins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FLIGHT ANXIETY EASED WITH ONE SIMPLE MENTAL TRICK, SAYS AUTHOR AND PODCAST HOST MEL ROBBINS</strong></a></p><p>Poehler said the passenger asked her to quiet down <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so he could relax</a>.</p><p>"My ‘Boston’ came out — let's just say that," she said of the situation.</p><p>Continuing their chat on the comedy podcast, Gasteyer described the moment as "the best thing I’ve ever seen."</p><p>Diane Gottsman, a national etiquette expert based in Texas, told Fox News Digital that situations like the one Poehler and Gasteyer described can be especially tense in confined public spaces such as airplane cabins.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>While some passengers may hesitate to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confront a celebrity</a> or prominent person directly, discomfort can still build among those nearby, said Gottsman.</p><p>Flight attendants have the authority to step in if a <a href="https://https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/social-etiquette" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passenger’s behavior</a> becomes disruptive, regardless of the passenger's status, she added.</p><p>"When [a situation] involves children and pets, it makes it even more of a sensitive issue because we feel the need to protect the innocent," she said.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Poehler’s team for further comment.</p><p>Poehler's new comedy podcast launched less than a year ago. </p><p>Tina Fey, Ariana Grande, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Paul Rudd have appeared on her podcast. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"I just want to say that I know I’m new to this game.
