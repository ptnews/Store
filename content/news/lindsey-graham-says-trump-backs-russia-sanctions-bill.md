Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Wednesday.</p><p>Graham made the statement after meeting with Trump, saying the Senate could vote on the legislation "hopefully as early as next week." A bipartisan group of senators has been drafting the suite of sanctions and negotiating to secure White House support for months.</p><p>"After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator [Richard] Blumenthal and many others," Graham said Wednesday.</p><p>"Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-us-could-snatch-venezuelan-tanker-not-under-wartime-authority-used-cartel-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHY THE US COULD SNATCH A VENEZUELAN TANKER — AND NOT UNDER ‘WARTIME’ AUTHORITY USED IN CARTEL STRIKES</strong></a></p><p>The bill seeks to dry up funding for Russia's war machine, both by targeting Russian industries as well as other countries that purchase Russian oil, such as China and India.</p><p>Agreement on the bill came just as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>U.S. forces</u></a> on Wednesday seized two sanctioned tankers in the Atlantic Ocean.
