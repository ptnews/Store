<p>Drinking heavily and consistently over an adult’s lifetime could lead to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/colon-cancer-now-deadliest-type-certain-group-americans-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher risk of colorectal cancer</a>, according to a study published in the journal Cancer by the American Cancer Society (ACS).</p><p>The study analyzed 20 years of data from more than 88,000 U.S. adults to determine how long-term drinking impacted the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) or precancerous colorectal adenomas (polyps).</p><p>The participants reported their average weekly intake of beer, wine and liquor intake during four age periods <strong>—</strong> 18 to 24, 25 to 39, 40 to 54,  and 55 and older.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/doctor-reveals-what-30-days-without-alcohol-does-brain-body-amid-dry-january" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOCTOR REVEALS WHAT 30 DAYS WITHOUT ALCOHOL DOES TO THE BRAIN AND BODY AMID DRY JANUARY</strong></a></p><p>"Heavy drinkers" were identified as having more than 14 drinks per week and "moderate drinkers" had between seven and 14 drinks per week.</p><p>The observational research revealed that consistent heavy drinking over adulthood was linked to a higher risk of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/colon-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colorectal cancer,</a> especially rectal cancer.</p><p>Heavy lifetime drinking was associated with a 25% higher overall CRC risk and nearly double the risk of rectal cancer. Moderate lifetime drinking had a lower overall CRC risk.</p><p>Compared to light drinkers, the consistently <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy drinkers</a> had about a 91% higher risk of CRC.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/doctors-reveal-what-reasonable-drinking-looks-like-who-should-avoid-alcohol" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EXPERTS REVEAL WHAT ‘REASONABLE’ DRINKING LOOKS LIKE – AND WHO SHOULD AVOID ALCOHOL</strong></a></p><p>For colorectal adenomas (precancerous polyps), higher current lifetime drinking did not show a strong pattern, although former drinkers showed a significantly lower risk of non-advanced adenoma compared to current light drinkers.</p><p>Out of the 88,092 participants, 1,679 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer.</p><p>The authors noted that the research was limited, as it was observational and not based on a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinical trial</a>. It also hinged on self-reported alcohol use.</p><p>The findings suggest that consistently heavy alcohol intake and higher average lifetime consumption "may increase CRC risk, whereas cessation may lower adenoma risk," the researchers stated.
