I have bangs now," she wrote.</p><p>The new look came three days after she had to remind her followers that the only social media she has are the ones that are verified.</p><p>"Hi, just as a very friendly reminder, I only have my verified social media accounts," she said in a video posted to X. "I do not have a Telegram or a Google Hangout or anything like that at all. I’m not playing online chess or ‘Words with Friends’ and if anyone is reaching out claiming to be a friend of mine or family or an agent or a manager – ignore them. They are scammers and impersonators.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/paige-spiranac-made-generous-donation-amid-golf-tournament-controversy-sports-personality-reveals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PAIGE SPIRANAC MADE GENEROUS DONATION AMID GOLF TOURNAMENT CONTROVERSY, SPORTS PERSONALITY REVEALS</strong></a></p><p>"There are so many out there. Just please be super aware and if anything seems fishy, that means that it is fishy.

"I’m talking tens of thousands of death threats, people telling me to kill myself. The most vile, horrendous stuff you could ever say to an individual that’s been in my DMs to the point where we were discussing me having to potentially get a restraining order. I mean, it’s serious stuff. It’s not easy, and it hasn’t been easy."</p><p>She said in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVT7qJ_00BM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube video</a> that she hadn’t touched a golf club "in a very long time" and felt like she needed a break from the sport.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
