<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> asserted that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey "is PLAYING WITH FIRE," issuing the warning in a Truth Social post on Wednesday morning.</p><p>"Surprisingly, Mayor Jacob Frey just stated that, ‘Minneapolis does not, and will not, enforce Federal Immigration Laws.’ This is after having had a very good conversation with him," the president said in the <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972940749866695" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>.</p><p>"Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!"

I want them preventing homicides, not hunting down a working dad who contributes to MPLS &amp; is from Ecuador. It’s similar to the policy your guy Rudy had in NYC. Everyone should feel safe calling 911," the mayor asserted in a <a href="https://x.com/MayorFrey/status/2016517831538446802" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> on X, making an apparent reference to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>The president issued the warning on Wednesday after Frey, who met with Trump's border czar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-homan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Homan</a> on Tuesday, declared in a Tuesday post on X that the city will not enforce federal immigration law.</p><p>"Today, Chief O'Hara and I met with Border Czar Homan and had a productive conversation. I reiterated that my main ask is for Operation Metro Surge to end as quickly as possible.
