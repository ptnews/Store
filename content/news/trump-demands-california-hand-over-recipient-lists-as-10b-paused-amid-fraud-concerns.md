<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration</a> is demanding California hand over a list of people and groups that receive taxpayer funds amid concerns money was fraudulently funneled to noncitizens.</p><p>On Tuesday, the administration announced it will pause more than $10 billion in funds to five Democrat-led states, including California, amid widespread claims of fraud. </p><p>In a series of letters to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the Administration for Children and Families said the Department of Health and Human Services will halt taxpayer funding to the Child Care Development Fund (CCDF), the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program and the Social Services Block Grant.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-republicans-call-independent-fraud-investigation-following-minnesota-revelations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NEW YORK REPUBLICANS CALL FOR INDEPENDENT FRAUD INVESTIGATION FOLLOWING MINNESOTA REVELATIONS</u></strong></a></p><p>The letters asked Newsom for "verified attendance documentation" for subsidized childcare services that include logs of hours and payment information from providers, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/07/us-news/trump-freezes-billions-in-child-care-funding-to-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Post</a> reported. </p><p>The letter from TANF asked for recipients’ names, addresses, Social Security numbers and dates of birth.</p><p>"These concerns have been heightened by recent federal prosecutions and additional allegations that substantial portions of federal resources were fraudulently diverted away from the American families they were intended to assist," ACS Assistant Secretary Alex J. Adams said in the letters, according to the Post. </p><p>"Additionally, ACF has reason to believe that the State of California is illicitly providing illegal aliens with CCDF benefits intended for American citizens and lawful permanent residents." </p><p>More than $7.3 billion in TANF funding would be withheld from the five states — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York — along with nearly $2.4 billion from the CCDF and another $869 million from the Social Services Block Grant.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/gop-lawmaker-demands-minnesota-fraud-treated-organized-crime-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>GOP LAWMAKER DEMANDS MINNESOTA FRAUD BE TREATED AS 'ORGANIZED CRIME' SCHEME</u></strong></a></p><p>In a statement to Fox News Digital, Newsom's office said the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) administers childcare and other essential programs that allow working families to "afford safe, reliable care so parents can go to work, support their families, and contribute to their communities."</p><p>"These funds are not optional — they are critical lifelines for working families across California," his office said. "The State of California aggressively investigates and prosecutes fraud. Using unsupported allegations to withhold child care funding only from states that didn’t vote for the President doesn’t stop fraud — it harms struggling moms and dads President Trump claims to be fighting for."</p><p>President Donald Trump has been highly critical <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of California</a> and Newsom. </p><p>"California, under Governor Gavin Newscum, is more corrupt than Minnesota, if that’s possible??? The Fraud Investigation of California has begun. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" he wrote Tuesday on Truth Social. </p><p>The pause came amid heavy scrutiny of Minnesota's massive welfare assistance fraud scandal.</p><p>More than 90 people — most from Minnesota's large Somali community — have been charged since 2022 in what has been described as the nation's largest <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-fraud-cases-explained-how-hundreds-millions-allegedly-slipped-through-state-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>COVID-era scheme</u></a>.</p><p>The amount of money stolen through money laundering operations involving fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers and Medicaid services is still being tabulated. But the U.S. attorney in Minnesota said the scope of the fraud could exceed $1 billion and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/magnitude-cannot-overstated-feds-say-minnesota-fraud-may-more-than-9b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>rise to as high as $9 billion.</u></a></p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Greg Wehner contributed to this report. </i></p>
