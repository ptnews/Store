It’s been diagnosed through biopsy and everything else and I’ll be fine. At least, I’ll do my best for everybody because I think I have an obligation to all of our readers and listeners that I get wonderful letters from," Hanson said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/victor-davis-hanson-trump-musk-need-reconcile-sake-americas-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: TRUMP AND MUSK NEED TO RECONCILE FOR THE SAKE OF AMERICA’S FUTURE</strong></a></p><p>Many took to social media to offer support: </p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/media"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</strong></a></p><p>Hanson has penned countless articles and books, including The New York Times bestseller "The Case for Trump."
