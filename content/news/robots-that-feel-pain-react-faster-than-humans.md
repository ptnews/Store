<p>Touch something hot, and your hand snaps back before you even think. That split second matters.</p><p>Sensory nerves in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your skin</a> send a rapid signal to your spinal cord, which triggers your muscles right away. Your brain catches up later. Most robots cannot do this. When a humanoid robot touches something harmful, sensor data usually travels to a central processor, waits for analysis and then sends instructions back to the motors. Even tiny delays can lead to broken parts or dangerous interactions. </p><p>As robots move into homes, hospitals and workplaces, that lag becomes a real problem.</p><p>Scientists at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Chinese Academy</a> of Sciences and collaborating universities are tackling this challenge with a neuromorphic robotic e-skin, also known as NRE-skin. Instead of acting like a simple pressure pad, this skin works more like a human nervous system. Traditional robot skins can tell when they are touched. They cannot tell whether that touch is harmful. The new e-skin can do both. That difference changes everything.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

The top layer acts as a protective outer covering, similar to the epidermis. Beneath it sit sensors and circuits that behave like sensory nerves. Even when nothing touches the robot, the skin sends a small electrical pulse to the robot every 75 to 150 seconds. This signal acts like a status check that says everything is fine. When the skin is damaged, that pulse stops. The robot immediately knows where it was injured and alerts its owner. Touch creates another signal. Normal contact sends neural-like spikes to the robot's central processor for interpretation. However, extreme pressure triggers something different.</p><p>If force exceeds a preset threshold, the skin generates a high-voltage spike that goes straight to the motors. This bypasses the central processor entirely. The result is a reflex. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/robots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The robot</a> can pull its arm away instantly, much like a human does after touching a hot surface. The pain signal only appears when the contact is truly dangerous, which helps prevent overreaction. This local reflex system reduces damage, improves safety and makes interactions feel more natural.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/robots-learn-1000-tasks-one-day-from-single-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ROBOTS LEARN 1,000 TASKS IN ONE DAY FROM A SINGLE DEMO</u></strong></a></p><p>The design includes another clever feature. The e-skin is made from magnetic patches that fit together like building blocks. If part of the skin gets damaged, an owner can remove the affected patch and snap in a new one within seconds. There is no need to replace the entire surface. That modular approach saves time, lowers costs and keeps robots in service longer.</p><p>Future service robots will need to work close to people. They will assist patients, help older adults and operate safely in crowded spaces. A sense of touch that includes pain and injury detection makes robots more aware and more trustworthy. It also reduces the risk of accidents caused by delayed reactions or sensor overload. The research team says their neural-inspired design improves robotic touch, safety and intuitive <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human-robot interaction.</a> It is a key step toward robots that behave less like machines and more like responsive partners.</p><p>The next challenge is sensitivity. The researchers want the skin to recognize multiple touches at the same time without confusion. If successful, robots could handle complex physical tasks while staying alert to danger across their entire surface. That brings humanoid robots one step closer to acting on instinct.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/robot-stuns-crowd-after-shocking-onstage-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ROBOT STUNS CROWD AFTER SHOCKING ONSTAGE REVEAL</u></strong></a></p><p><strong>Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?</strong></p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?
