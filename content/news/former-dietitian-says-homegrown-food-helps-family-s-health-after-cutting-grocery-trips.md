<p>A Minnesota homesteader says she grows nearly all the food her family eats, improving their overall health and cutting grocery store trips to about once a month.</p><p>Katie Krejci, 38, began working toward a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-sufficient lifestyle</a> more than a decade ago, starting with a small vegetable garden, she told Fox News Digital and news agency SWNS.</p><p>Over time, that hobby expanded into a full-scale homesteading operation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/5-gut-boosting-fruits-eat-more-2026-better-digestion-experts-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>5 GUT-BOOSTING FRUITS TO EAT MORE OF IN 2026 FOR BETTER DIGESTION, EXPERTS SAY</strong></a></p><p>In June 2023, Krejci and her husband, Ryan, purchased five acres of land in northern Minnesota and moved into a 960-square-foot hunting shed. </p><p>From there, they began growing fruits and vegetables, raising chickens for eggs and meat, and sourcing additional food <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/hunting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through hunting</a> and bartering with neighbors.</p><p>Krejci said the couple now produces about 65% of their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">total food</a> needs on their homestead, including nearly all of their produce, eggs, poultry, venison and maple syrup.</p><p>She estimates they grow about 99% of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produce they eat</a>.</p><p>Krejci told Fox News Digital the homesteading lifestyle has led to improved health, reduced stress and a greater sense of self-sufficiency.</p><p>"It [is] comforting to have food stored away, but I rest easy knowing that we're eating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food that is nutrient-dense,</a> picked at its peak state of ripeness and fully organic," she said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/my-whole-life-lie-former-vegan-chef-sinks-teeth-cattle-ranching" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'MY WHOLE LIFE WAS A LIE': FORMER VEGAN CHEF SINKS HER TEETH INTO CATTLE RANCHING</strong></a></p><p>Krejci said she goes to the grocery store for items they can't grow in Minnesota's climate.</p><p>Those trips typically cost about $50 every four to six weeks. They're mainly for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/eating-one-type-fruit-could-lower-depression-risk-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citrus fruits</a> like lemons, limes and bananas, along with household necessities like toilet paper.</p><p>The couple also buys certain items in bulk from an organic food supplier, spending an average of about $300 a month on staples like rice, oats, olive oil, nuts and cheese.</p><p>Krejci said the transition to homesteading happened gradually and grew out of a love of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the outdoors</a>. The shift has completely changed how often the family relies on stores, she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"I haven't done a traditional weekly grocery store run in four years," she told SWNS.</p><p>Before turning to homesteading full-time, Krejci worked as a registered dietitian. She said she eventually stepped away from her hospital role after feeling disconnected from the work and wanting to focus more on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term health</a> and illness prevention.</p><p>Krejci quit her full-time job in August 2023. She now earns about three times her former income as a content creator, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/viral-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing videos</a> and advice online about food preservation, gardening and harvesting crops, she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>The family's focus is on maintaining what they're already growing and continuing to build toward greater self-sufficiency, with the goal of eventually moving off the grid entirely.</p><p>Although she hasn't experienced major health drawbacks, burnout can be a challenge if people take on too much at once, Krejci told Fox News Digital. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>She encouraged newcomers to start small and build gradually.</p><p>"Homesteading is a marathon, not a sprint," she said.</p>
