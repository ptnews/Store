<p>Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/john-fetterman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Fetterman, D-Pa.,</a> expressed support for the idea of the U.S. buying Greenland, which is linked to the nation of Denmark.</p><p>"I believe Greenland has massive strategic benefits for the United States. I do not support taking it by force. America is not a bully. Ideally, we purchase it — similar to our purchases of Alaska or the Louisiana Purchase. Acquiring Greenland is a many decades-old conversation," the senator noted in a Wednesday <a href="https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/2008958683632353758" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post on X.</a></p><p>In a Fox News appearance last year, Fetterman had similarly noted that he would not support forcibly seizing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenland</a> but expressed an openness to the prospect of purchasing the land. He pointed to the Louisiana Purchase and the Alaska Purchase.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fetterman-open-potential-greenland-acquisition-declares-support-laken-riley-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FETTERMAN OPEN TO POTENTIAL GREENLAND ACQUISITION, DECLARES SUPPORT FOR LAKEN RILEY ACT</strong></a></p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> has been eyeing the island, categorizing the U.S. acquiring the territory as a national security matter.</p><p>In a 2024 Truth Social <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113698764270730405" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post, </a>he asserted, "For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-senator-introduces-bill-stop-trump-from-invading-another-country-whim-over-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEM SENATOR INTRODUCES BILL TO STOP TRUMP FROM INVADING ‘ANOTHER COUNTRY ON A WHIM’ OVER GREENLAND</strong></a></p><p>During a Sunday news gaggle aboard Air Force One, he said, "We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security. And the European Union needs us to have it."</p><p>Trump has previously floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in the past, but the commander-in-chief spoke about the Artic territory recently when someone brought it up during the gaggle on Air Force One after the U.S. operation in Venezuela that captured Nicolás Maduro. Since then, the president said the U.S. is in charge of Venezuela and will be for the foreseeable future until a secure transition of power can take place.</p><p>In a Fox News appearance on Monday, Fetterman described the U.S. capture of Maduro as a "good thing," calling the operation "surgical." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-defends-trumps-venezuela-military-operation-against-criticism-from-fellow-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FETTERMAN DEFENDS TRUMP'S VENEZUELA MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST CRITICISM FROM FELLOW DEMOCRATS</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p><p>"Removing Maduro was positive for Venezuela. As a Democrat, I don’t understand why we can’t acknowledge a good development for Venezuelans — and how deft our military’s execution of that plan was," he noted in a Tuesday <a href="https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/2008725660324479066" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post on X.</a></p>
