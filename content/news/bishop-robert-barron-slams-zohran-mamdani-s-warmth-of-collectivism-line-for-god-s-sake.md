<p>Bishop Robert Barron, a prominent Catholic leader, slammed socialist New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/zohran-mamdani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zohran Mamdani’s</a> inauguration line promoting the "warmth of collectivism," saying, "God’s sake, spare me."</p><p>During his inaugural address, the newly minted socialist mayor and New York’s first Muslim mayor, declared, "We will replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/critics-say-mamdanis-vow-swap-rugged-individualism-warmth-collectivism-has-sinister-undertone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the warmth of collectivism</a>."</p><p>The line prompted immediate backlash from many conservatives who expressed alarm at such a phrase being used by the leader of America’s biggest city.</p><p>Barron, a popular podcaster and founder of "Word on Fire," <a href="https://x.com/BishopBarron/status/2007122520898449604" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">took to X</a> to say Mamdani’s declaration "took my breath away."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mamdani-sworn-ag-james-private-midnight-ceremony" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MAMDANI SWORN IN BY AG JAMES IN PRIVATE MIDNIGHT CEREMONY</strong></a></p><p>"He said he intended to replace ‘the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism.’ Collectivism in its various forms is responsible for the deaths of at least 100 million people in the last century," Barron wrote.</p><p>"For God’s sake, spare me the ‘warmth of collectivism.'</p><p>"Socialist and communist forms of government around the world today — Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, etc. — are disastrous," explained Barron. "Catholic social teaching has consistently condemned socialism and has embraced the market economy, which people like Mamdani caricature as ‘rugged individualism.’</p><p>"In fact, it is the economic system that is based upon the rights, freedom and dignity of the human person."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hours-after-taking-office-nyc-mayor-mamdani-targets-landlords-moves-intervene-private-bankruptcy-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOURS AFTER TAKING OFFICE, NYC MAYOR MAMDANI TARGETS LANDLORDS, MOVES TO INTERVENE IN PRIVATE BANKRUPTCY CASE</strong></a></p><p>Barron was not the only critic who voiced alarm about Mamdani’s declaration.</p><p>Florida Republican Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ron-desantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron DeSantis</a> wrote on X that the "warmth" of collectivism "always requires coercion and force."</p><p>"How many dead over the past 100 years due to collectivist ideologies?"

He said the task force will review city-owned properties and identify sites suitable for housing development no later than July 1.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/socialist-mayor-mamdani-inaugurated-alongside-bernie-sanders-aoc-new-years-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SOCIALIST NYC MAYOR MAMDANI INAUGURATED ALONGSIDE BERNIE SANDERS AND AOC ON NEW YEAR’S DAY</strong></a></p><p>The third executive order created a SPEED task force, which Mamdani said stands for Streamlining Procedures to Expedite Equitable Development.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., of being a terrorist sympathizer.</p><p>He has repeatedly described Israel as an apartheid state, accused it of committing genocide in Gaza, and said Prime Minister <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> should be arrested. Mamdani has also said he will not tolerate antisemitism in New York and vowed to increase funding to combat hate crimes.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani’s office for comment but did not immediately receive a response.</p>
