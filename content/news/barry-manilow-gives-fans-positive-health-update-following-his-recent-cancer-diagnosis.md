My heart skipped a beat when I heard you were sick," a third fan said. "So glad to see you are doing well and recuperating."</p><p>Manilow first shared that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/barry-manilow-undergo-surgery-cancerous-spot-lung-credits-pure-luck-early-detection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cancerous spot had been</a> found on his lungs in an Instagram post shared in late December 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTCM2MiERGO/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>APP USERS CLICK HERE FOR POST</strong></a></p><p>He explained that after suffering "through six weeks of bronchitis followed by a relapse of another five weeks," his doctors ordered more tests out of an abundance of caution and found something more serious.</p><p>"Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK. The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed. It's pure luck (and a great doctor) that it was found so early. That's the good news."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>"The bad news is that now that the ‘Christmas A Gift of Love’ concerts are over I'm going into surgery to have the spot removed," he continued. "The doctors do not believe it has spread and I'm taking tests to confirm the diagnosis. So, that's it. No chemo. No radiation. Just chicken soup and I Love Lucy reruns."</p><p>He went on to apologize to all his fans <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/barry-manilow-hospitalized-with-bronchial-infection-forced-to-cancel-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who had already purchased tickets</a>, telling them he was "looking forward to the January shows" as much as they were and that he "hate[s] having to move everything around."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

He explained that he and his co-producer at the time, Ron Duarte, "never thought it would ever get played on the radio."</p><p>"But we took it to a disco, when there were discos and, we asked the DJ to play it," Manilow said. "And everybody ran to the dance floor and started to dance like they were back in the 1940s. They were dipping the girls and all because, you know, it's ‘Copa.’ And, I said to Ron, we may be onto something with this one. And then, it turned out to be the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/barry-manilow-did-not-think-copacabana-would-be-a-hit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular song in my catalog</a>."</p>
