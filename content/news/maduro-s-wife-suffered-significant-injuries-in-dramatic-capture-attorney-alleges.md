Donnelly requested that Flores receive a full X-ray to determine whether she fractured a rib in the incident.</p><p>Flores was already wearing two bandages on her face, one on her forehead and another above her eye.</p><p>Both she and her husband <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/whos-who-maduro-case-judge-prosecutors-defense-lawyers-now-facing-off" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism</a> and other charges in their first appearance on Monday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/deals/switzerland-imposes-4-year-asset-freeze-linked-maduro-associates-following-venezuelan-leaders-capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SWITZERLAND IMPOSES 4-YEAR ASSET FREEZE LINKED TO MADURO, ASSOCIATES FOLLOWING VENEZUELAN LEADER'S CAPTURE</strong></a></p><p>Maduro faces four charges: <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/narco-terror" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narco-terrorism conspiracy</a>, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.</p><p>Flores faces three charges, including cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.</p><p>Donnelly filed a motion to serve as counsel for Flores earlier Monday.

His white collar practice included FCPA investigations, Healthcare Fraud, joint SEC matters, large scale investor fraud, and cyber security matters," Donnelly's biography on the website for the Parker Sanchez &amp; Donnelly law firm reads.</p><p>The Texas House of Representatives also enlisted Donnelly to assist in the 2023 investigation and impeachment trial for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Paxton's impeachment case made it to the Texas Senate, but he was ultimately acquitted on all charges.</p><p>Maduro and Flores, who have been married for 12 years, were first introduced while working closely with Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez.
