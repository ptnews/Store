<p>Menopause may be best known for hot flashes and mood swings, but it can also come with many other less talked-about symptoms, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skin changes</a>.</p><p>Studies have shown that a majority of women report skin problems as they age — in particular, one they might not have experienced since their teen years.</p><p>Dr. Amy Wechsler, a dual board-certified dermatologist and psychiatrist in Manhattan, specializes in treating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/endocrine/menopause" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perimenopausal and menopausal</a> women who are battling acne — sometimes for the first time in their lives.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/fda-moves-lift-black-box-warnings-from-hormone-therapies-menopause-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FDA MOVES TO LIFT ‘BLACK BOX’ WARNINGS FROM HORMONE THERAPIES FOR MENOPAUSE SYMPTOMS</strong></a></p><p>"For them, it's just horrible because they've never had it — it's so foreign to them," she told Fox News Digital. "There's so much psychological overlap and effects of acne on people in terms of lowering self-esteem and self-confidence, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing anxiety</a> and sometimes depression."</p><p>For most women, there are two "peaks of acne" — one during adolescence and another at perimenopause and menopause, according to the doctor. </p><p>"There are many women who have been clear of acne for 20 years, and then, starting at around 40-ish, they start to break out again," she said. "And this time it's centered around their lower face, chin and jawline, which is where <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin/acne" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hormonal acne</a> tends to occur."</p><p>"Women often come to see me, at age 35 to 55, complaining about wrinkles and pimples — and they feel too young for their wrinkles and too old for their pimples," she said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/eating-common-vitamin-c-packed-fruit-might-transform-skin-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EATING A COMMON VITAMIN-C PACKED FRUIT MIGHT TOTALLY TRANSFORM SKIN, STUDY FINDS</strong></a></p><p>While men who have a genetic predisposition for acne may continue to break out into older adulthood, for women, "there's a particular hormonal component from the late 30s through the early 50s, around perimenopause and menopause."</p><p>The breakouts usually stop when menopause is finished, Wechsler said.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that taking GLP-1 weight loss and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diabetes medications</a> could increase acne prevalence, but others have not identified a link.</p><p>"I see patients all day long who are taking GLP-1s, so I would imagine if there were a link, I probably would have picked up on something by now," Wechsler said.</p><p>The main remedy for aging-related acne is taking hormone-related medications.</p><p><strong>"</strong>Spironolactone is specifically for hormonal acne in women," Wechsler said. "It blocks testosterone from binding to the testosterone receptors in the lower face."</p><p>Going on hormone replacement therapy or a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/reproductive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">birth control pill</a> can also help with acne, she noted, but treatments will vary based on each person’s situation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</strong></a></p><p>"Some people come in with just small blackheads and whiteheads, and they might not need something oral," she said. </p><p>"That's when we might prescribe something topical, often a retinoid with the brand names of Differin, Retin-A or Tretinoin. Those are often very helpful for smaller pimples. Also, they're <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/longevity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-aging</a>, which is nice. They grow collagen."</p><p>Wechsler said she sometimes prescribes a low dose of doxycycline, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an antibiotic</a> that also works as an anti-inflammatory. </p><p>"If the acne is different or covering more of the face or the upper face, sometimes we’ll try a low dose of Accutane," she added. "It really depends on the individual and how bad the acne is."</p><p>While genetics and hormones can contribute to acne, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress can also affect the skin</a>, the doctor said. One of the best ways to address this is to get optimal sleep, which is the "anti-inflammatory" time when the body heals.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>"Unfortunately, many Americans don't <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get enough sleep</a>," Wechsler said. "Adults need seven-and-a-half to eight hours. That's when the stress molecule, cortisol, is at its lowest, and when all the healing molecules, like beta-endorphins and growth hormones and oxytocin, are at their highest."</p><p>In addition to sleep, the doctor recommends looking for ways to lower cortisol levels during the day to help reduce stress levels — <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as exercising</a>, getting fresh air, connecting with friends, and doing stretching or deep breathing.</p><p>For people who are acne-prone, Wechsler also emphasized the importance of choosing the right <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin/cosmetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skincare products</a>.</p><p>"It’s really important that all products are non-comedogenic, or oil-free," she recommended. "That means the company has tested the product and that it will not clog your pores and cause pimples."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>It’s also important to wash your face after exercising and at the end of the day, and to never go to sleep in makeup, the doctor advised. </p><p>For those who are bothered by acne and have not seen results after two months of taking over-the-counter products, Wechsler recommends <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeing a dermatologist</a> for help.</p>
