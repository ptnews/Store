<p>When someone gets a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer diagnosis</a>, the initial reaction is usually to undergo treatment as quickly as possible — but for some types of disease, doctors may recommend a more conservative approach.</p><p>For certain cancers, immediate or aggressive treatment can cause more harm than good, according to multiple <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical experts</a>.</p><p>For example, treating slow-growing tumors with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy could create significant side effects without a survival benefit.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/prostate-cancer-patients-see-longer-survival-new-combination-drug" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS SEE LONGER SURVIVAL WITH NEW COMBINATION DRUG </strong></a></p><p>"The fact that so many cancers will never kill you is not a justification for not knowing, because there is still plenty of room for 'watchful waiting,' as well as interventions that may improve quality of life even if they don't extend life," Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, told Fox News Digital.</p><p>This is especially true as targeted <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer treatments</a> emerge, which are more personalized and less likely to cause severe side effects, according to the doctor.</p><p>"The fact that cancers are occurring earlier is a justification for heightened screenings, not the opposite," Siegel added. "Information is power — what you do with that information is based on clinical judgment and the art of medicine."</p><p>Below are some types of cancer that may not warrant treatment, according to research and doctors’ guidance.</p><p>While some types of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/prostate-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prostate cancer</a> should be treated right away, others are better addressed by "watchful waiting," according to Sanoj Punnen, M.D., a urologic oncologist with Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Health System. </p><p>"With respect to prostate cancer, for most low-risk cancers (Gleason 6 or grade group 1), we recommend initial observation and surveillance rather than immediate treatment," he told Fox News Digital.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-prostate-cancer-test-pinpoints-disease-better-than-psa-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong><u>NEW PROSTATE CANCER TEST PINPOINTS DISEASE BETTER THAN PSA OPTION, STUDY FINDS</u></strong></a></p><p>The Gleason score is a grading system that ranks prostate cancer cells in terms of how abnormal they are, with 6 being the lowest grade and 10 being the highest grade (barely resembling normal cells).</p><p>"For high-grade tumors like Gleason 8, 9 or 10, we believe they progress quickly, so we recommend treatment to prevent the risk of metastasis," said Punnen, who is also vice chair of research and a professor with the Desai Sethi Urology Institute at UHealth. "For low-risk tumors, we think they pose little risk, so we recommend just observation."</p><p>"But in the end, we can't be sure, so our approach to observation includes serial monitoring of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/cancer-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer status</a> with PSA, MRI and occasional biopsy to ensure the tumor isn't progressing."</p><p>Also known as stage 0 breast cancer, DCIS is a non-invasive disease marked by abnormal cells in the lining of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breast milk ducts</a>. The "in situ" is Latin for "in the original place," which indicates that the cancer has not spread outside the milk ducts.</p><p>For this precancerous, very early-stage breast condition, careful monitoring may be more prudent than immediate surgery, research shows.</p><p>A 2024 study by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute found that active monitoring for DCIS resulted in similar quality of life, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health</a> and symptom progression over a two-year period compared to a standard surgical approach.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-study-questions-whether-annual-mammograms-necessary-most-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW STUDY QUESTIONS WHETHER ANNUAL MAMMOGRAMS ARE NECESSARY FOR MOST WOMEN</strong></a></p><p>"These results suggest that in the short term, active monitoring is a reasonable approach to management of low-risk DCIS," the lead researcher said in a press release. "If longer-term follow-up supports the safety of active management from a cancer outcome standpoint, this approach could be considered as an option for women with this condition."</p><p>"But it is also critical that we understand how women feel when they are living with this ‘watch and wait’ approach and how it impacts their overall quality of life."</p><p>Other research has suggested that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/womens-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women with low-risk DCIS</a> did not have a higher rate of invasive cancer after two years of active monitoring, although each patient should discuss their individual risk level with an oncologist.</p><p>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system, which includes the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, bone marrow and other tissues. </p><p>Indolent lymphomas are those that "grow and spread slowly," according to the American Cancer Society.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/deadly-cancer-hiding-plain-sight-why-most-patients-never-get-screened" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>THE DEADLY CANCER HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT — AND WHY MOST PATIENTS NEVER GET SCREENED</strong></a></p><p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends watchful waiting for asymptomatic, slow-growing follicular lymphoma, as a means of avoiding the toxicity of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chemotherapy and immunotherapy</a> until it’s absolutely necessary.</p><p>The Lymphoma Research Foundation confirms that doctors recommend "active surveillance" for some patients with slow-growing lymphoma.</p><p>"This approach may be started after the initial diagnosis or after relapse, depending on the situation," the foundation states on its website. "Active treatment is started if the patient begins to develop lymphoma-related symptoms or if there are signs that the disease is progressing."</p><p>Treatment should be started right away for aggressive (fast-growing) lymphomas.</p><p>One of the most common adult leukemias, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/blood-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a> (CLL) originates in white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the bone marrow and then spreads to the bloodstream, according to the American Cancer Society.</p><p>CLL tends to grow slowly, with many patients experiencing no symptoms for years.
