<p>Diego Pavia was a Heisman Trophy finalist in his last year with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/vanderbilt-commodores" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanderbilt Commodores,</a> and he is now looking ahead to a potential NFL career in the next few months.</p><p>As NFL scouts and media descended on the Senior Bowl this week, Pavia’s measurables were recorded. He was listed at 5-foot-9 7/8 and 198 pounds.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Height is something that doesn’t necessarily define a player’s career, but it is something teams take into account when making their draft selections. The average height for an NFL quarterback is somewhere between 6-foot-2 and 6-foot-3. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bryce-young" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryce Young</a> and Kyler Murray are among the smallest quarterbacks in the NFL at 5-foot-10.</p><p>Pavia didn’t seem to be too concerned with his vitals when he spoke to reporters on Monday.</p><p>"Yeah, my size has been doubted my whole life," he said, <a href="https://www.al.com/sports/2026/01/i-view-myself-as-a-winner-vanderbilts-diego-pavia-out-to-prove-doubters-wrong-again-at-senior-bowl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via AL.com</a>. "I feel like the only thing the NFL cares about is can you win, and I view myself as a winner. I’ve been fortunate with all these great teams that I’ve had — we’ve never had a losing season. So that’s something to look forward to, I hope, for the rest of my career, that’s how it’s going to be.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/giants-cam-skattebo-says-college-earnings-from-nil-creating-entitled-nfl-rookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GIANTS' CAM SKATTEBO SAYS COLLEGE EARNINGS FROM NIL ARE CREATING ENTITLED NFL ROOKIES</strong></a></p><p>"I feel like God has blessed me in so many ways to be a connector, and I feel like that’s one of my superpowers that I’ve got — I can connect. We unite, and then once you unite, you want to play for one another, and once you give 120% effort, there’s no one that can stop your team."</p><p>Heart and hustle are something Pavia showed during his time with Vanderbilt.</p><p>He had 2,293 passing yards and 20 touchdown passes in 2024 during his first season with Vanderbilt following his transfer from New Mexico State. Vanderbilt was 7-6 and delivered a major win over Alabama.</p><p>In 2025, Vanderbilt was 10-3 and nearly made the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">College Football Playoff</a>.
