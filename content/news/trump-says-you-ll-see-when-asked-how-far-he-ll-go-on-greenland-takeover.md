<p>President <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Donald Trump</u></a> fueled fresh uncertainty Tuesday, offering a terse "you’ll see" when asked at the White House how far he would go to get Greenland.</p><p>Trump dismissed concerns that Greenlanders do not want to join the U.S. and that a move to seize the island would undermine the NATO alliance.</p><p>In recent weeks, Trump has zeroed in on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Greenland</u></a>, the world’s largest island and a strategic outpost in the Arctic.</p><p>The remote, semi-autonomous Danish territory, a NATO ally, hosts a key U.S. military base and occupies a strategic position in an Arctic region growing more competitive as melting ice opens new shipping lanes and access to critical resources. </p><p> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-trump-zeroed-greenland-why-matters-3-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>WHY TRUMP ZEROED IN ON GREENLAND AND WHY IT MATTERS IN 3 MAPS</u></strong></a></p><p>Trump has repeatedly framed Greenland as a national security necessity, arguing that Russia and China would gain ground in the region if the U.S. does not acquire it.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-threatens-tariffs-countries-opposing-greenland-takeover-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP THREATENS TARIFFS ON COUNTRIES OPPOSING GREENLAND TAKEOVER PLANS</u></strong></a></p><p>The latest revelation comes as Trump heads to the snow-capped city of Davos, Switzerland, where global leaders have flocked to attend the World Economic Forum. </p><p>The issue of Greenland is likely to dominate the sidelines of the summit as European leaders grapple with Trump's fresh threat to <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-threatens-tariffs-countries-opposing-greenland-takeover-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>impose tariffs</u></a> on countries opposing his Greenland plans.</p><p>The threat of additional tariffs comes as his administration awaits a Supreme Court ruling on whether some of the trade duties he imposed in 2025 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-tariff-boom-hits-record-highs-supreme-court-showdown-looms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>were legal.</u></a> </p><p>European leaders suggested over the weekend that they would be willing to hit back with <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/eu-hold-emergency-summit-over-trumps-tariffs-over-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retaliatory measures</a> worth up to $107.7 billion.</p><p>Trump first raised the idea of acquiring Greenland during his previous term, drawing swift pushback from Denmark and other European leaders, resistance he now appears willing to confront again.</p><p>Whether the Trump administration strikes a deal to take over Greenland remains unclear. But as ice melts and competition in the Arctic intensifies, the island’s strategic importance is only likely to grow.</p>
