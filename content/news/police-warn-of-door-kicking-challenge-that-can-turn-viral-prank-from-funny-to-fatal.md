<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Police are warning families</a> about a dangerous social media trend after videos surfaced showing people violently kicking in front doors as part of the "door-kicking challenge," a prank authorities say can escalate into serious injury, criminal charges or worse.</p><p>According to a spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ontario, California, Police Department,</a> the trend — which involves people forcefully kicking or slamming doors at homes and then running away while recording the stunt — has resurfaced online and prompted renewed concern nationwide.</p><p>While there have been numerous incidents reported across the country, including cases resulting in serious injury or death, the Ontario Police Department has seen only a few related calls for service within the city, the spokesperson said.</p><p>"To date, none of our local incidents have resulted in injuries or criminal charges," the spokesperson said, adding that the behavior typically occurs during nighttime hours and most often involves preteen and teenage children.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/watch-three-florida-teenagers-arrested-viral-door-kick-challenge-targeting-homeowners" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WATCH: THREE FLORIDA TEENAGERS ARRESTED IN VIRAL ‘DOOR KICK CHALLENGE’ TARGETING HOMEOWNERS</strong></a></p><p>Police say the trend remains dangerous, though.</p><p>"This behavior is particularly dangerous due to the risk of serious injury to both participants and residents, significant property damage and the potential for escalation with homeowners," the spokesperson said. "Participants may also face serious legal consequences, including arrest and criminal charges such as vandalism or trespassing."</p><p>The spokesperson said the department chose to issue a public warning because the trend has recently regained traction on social media and officers wanted to proactively outline the risks and consequences for the community.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/homeowners-terrorized-viral-challenge-police-warn-prank-could-turn-deadly-teens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOMEOWNERS TERRORIZED IN VIRAL CHALLENGE AS POLICE WARN PRANK COULD TURN DEADLY FOR TEENS</strong></a></p><p>Ontario police also clarified that the video shared on the department’s social media platforms does not show incidents from within the city.</p><p>"The video includes examples of door-kicking incidents circulating online from outside our jurisdiction," the spokesperson said. "None of the clips shown depict incidents that occurred within the City of Ontario; they were used to illustrate the broader nationwide trend."</p><p>Recent incidents elsewhere highlight why police say the behavior can quickly turn dangerous. In North Carolina, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ding-dong-ditch-prank-erupts-gunfire-leaving-juvenile-shot-homeowner-under-arrest-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a juvenile was shot</a> in the leg after a homeowner fired at a vehicle during a late-night ding-dong ditch-style prank, according to police.
