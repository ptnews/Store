"Our office has jurisdiction to review this matter for potential criminal conduct by the federal agents involved and we will do so."</p><p>Moriarty added that the lawsuit is just one of the actions her office is taking "to ensure that a thorough and transparent investigation can be completed at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/state-and-local" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state level</a>."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/read-it-bondi-sends-warning-letter-gov-walz-warning-minnesotas-immigration-policies-endanger-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>READ IT: BONDI SENDS WARNING LETTER TO GOV WALZ WARNING MINNESOTA’S IMMIGRATION POLICIES ENDANGER AGENTS</strong></a></p><p>In announcing the litigation, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/attorney-general" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison</a> asserted that "federal agents are not above the law and Alex Pretti is certainly not beneath it."</p><p>"A full, impartial, and transparent investigation into his fatal shooting at the hands of DHS agents is non-negotiable," he said in a statement. "Minnesota law enforcement is currently carrying out such an investigation, and it is essential that the evidence collected by federal agents is preserved and turned over to state officials. Today’s lawsuit aims to bar the federal government from destroying or tampering with any of the evidence they have collected."</p><p>Ellison added that "justice will be done."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/federal-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the White House</a>, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department for comment.</p><p>In a separate statement, Ellison said he shares "intense grief and anger" that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-briefed-border-patrol-involved-shooting-minneapolis-mayor-demands-end-enforcement-operation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pretti was shot and killed</a> during the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/appeals-court-hands-trump-admin-victory-minnesota-ice-force-restrictions-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>APPEALS COURT HANDS TRUMP ADMIN 'VICTORY' IN MINNESOTA ICE FORCE RESTRICTIONS CASE</strong></a></p><p>He said his office will argue in court Monday to end "this illegal and unconstitutional occupation of our cities and the terror and violence it's inflicting."</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security said it is leading the investigation into the shooting.</p><p>Pretti was a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ICU nurse.
