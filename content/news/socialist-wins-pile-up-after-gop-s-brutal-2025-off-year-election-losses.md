<p>Republicans suffered a statistically bleak showing in the 2025 elections, but the losses went beyond the scoreboard.</p><p>Across several jurisdictions – including the nation’s largest city – voters elevated socialist, socialist-aligned and far-left Democrats to public office, underscoring an ideological shift that extended well past individual races.</p><p>Here are the top five races won by such leaders preparing to take office in the new year.</p><p>New York State Assemblyman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/socialist-wave-spreads-coast-coast-progressive-democrats-rally-around-zohran-mamdanis-nyc-win" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zohran Mamdani, D-Astoria</a>, will take the oath of office as is tradition as the ball drops to mark New Year’s Day in Times Square.</p><p>Mamdani, who was born in Kampala, Uganda, follows British-born Abraham Beame as the only other immigrant <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City</a> mayor since the Colonial era.</p><p>Mamdani was endorsed by and associated with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and ran on a platform of several public freebies including transit and childcare as well as rent freezes and higher taxes on corporations.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/socialist-wave-reaches-west-coast-los-angeles-mayor-karen-bass-gets-mamdani-like-challenger" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SOCIALIST WAVE REACHES WEST COAST AS LOS ANGELES MAYOR KAREN BASS GETS A MAMDANI-LIKE CHALLENGER</strong></a></p><p>The millennial defeated old-guard Democrat <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/andrew-cuomo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Cuomo</a> and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the November election. Mamdani garnered just over 50% of the vote, leading Cuomo supporters to blame Sliwa – the founder of the anti-crime Guardian Angels who accrued about 7% of the vote – for having a socialist installed in America’s financial capital.</p><p>While much of the nation was transfixed by the New York City mayoral election, a similar dynamic was playing out on the opposite coast, in Seattle.</p><p>Mayor Bruce Harrell, a Democrat viewed as more moderate than other local members of the party, won his 2021 election on a platform of combating homelessness, property crimes, racial violence and other issues.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/incumbent-seattle-mayor-concedes-mamdani-style-socialist-who-tapped-her-parents-money-while-running" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>INCUMBENT SEATTLE MAYOR CONCEDES TO MAMDANI-STYLE 'SOCIALIST' WHO TAPPED HER PARENTS FOR MONEY WHILE RUNNING</strong></a></p><p>"Look at what Seattle has become," <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/bruce-harrell-seattle-mayor-campaign/281-88051c15-2675-4dcc-af55-7013dfd4449f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">he said</a> when running to replace Jenny Durkan, who had overseen the city when the anarchist CHAZ installation was erected in the middle of town.</p><p>Harrell’s re-election, however, was unsuccessful this fall, as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/meet-socialist-mamdani-style-mayor-just-elected-run-west-coasts-5th-largest-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">socialist-aligned Democrat Katie Wilson</a> edged him out by 50-49 in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/state-and-local" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonpartisan general election</a>.</p><p>Wilson previously <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/video/ebof-seattle-socialist-mayor-elect-katie-wilson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">told CNN</a> that she ran for mayor due to the city’s affordability crisis, adding that "being socialist is first of all about a belief in good governance.
