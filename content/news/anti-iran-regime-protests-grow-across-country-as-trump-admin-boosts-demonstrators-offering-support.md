<p>Protests spread across Iran on Tuesday after President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> and other administration officials voiced support for demonstrators. Speaking Monday, Trump pointed to Iran’s economic collapse and long-standing public discontent while stopping short of calling for regime change.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Iran</a>, demonstrations entered a third consecutive day, expanding beyond the capital’s commercial center. The exiled opposition coalition National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) reported widespread strikes and student protests across Tehran and multiple provincial cities, describing clashes with security forces and anti-government chants. A video obtained by the NCRI appears to show protesters pushing back security forces, forcing them to leave the scene on Tehran’s Jomhouri Street. </p><p>Iran International reported that universities emerged as major protest hubs, with rallies at Tehran University, Sharif University of Technology, Shahid Beheshti University, Elm-o-Sanat University and Khajeh Nasir University. Security forces tightened entry controls at campuses and reinforced offices linked to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-president-says-country-total-war-us-israel-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRANIAN PRESIDENT SAYS HIS COUNTRY IS AT 'TOTAL WAR' WITH THE US, ISRAEL AND EUROPE: REPORTS</strong></a></p><p>Strikes spread across Tehran’s Shoush and Molavi districts and into Isfahan’s Naqsh-e Jahan Square, while parts of Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and the gold market shut down. Mobile phone traders gathered outside major shopping centers after closing their stores. Protests turned violent in several locations, with tear gas fired in Tehran and Malard and reports of live fire in Hamadan. Nighttime demonstrations were reported from Qeshm Island in the south to Zanjan and Hamadan in the north, with videos showing chants of "death to the dictator."</p><p>Speaking at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, Trump said he was "not going to talk about overthrow of a regime." Instead, he focused on Iran’s deteriorating economy and the state’s violent response to protests. "They’ve got tremendous inflation. Their economy is busted, the economy is no good," Trump said. </p><p>He said that when Iranians <a href="https://https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gather to protest</a>, the regime responds with lethal force.</p><p>"Every time they have a riot or somebody forms a group, little or big, they start shooting people," Trump said. "You know, they kill people. All of a sudden people start getting shot and that group disbanded pretty quickly."</p><p>Trump said he has watched the unrest build for years, describing Iran’s leadership as brutal.</p><p>"I’ve watched this for years — there is tremendous discontent," he said. "I’ve watched it for years, and vicious, vicious people." His remarks came as protests intensified following the collapse of Iran’s currency to historic lows. The rial fell to roughly 1.45 million per U.S. dollar on the open market, triggering strikes and demonstrations centered on Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and spreading to other major cities, according to Iran International’s live reporting. Videos and eyewitness accounts described heavy security deployments, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-protesters-clash-security-forces-tear-gas-fills-tehran-streets-amid-nationwide-unrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clashes with demonstrators</a> and the use of tear gas as unrest widened.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-vows-knock-hell-out-of-iran-nuclear-program-rebuilt-again-after-high-stakes-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP VOWS TO ‘KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF’ IRAN IF NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS REBUILT AGAIN AFTER HIGH-STAKES MEETING</strong></a></p><p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz issued a direct message of support. "The people of Iran want freedom," Waltz wrote on X. "We stand with Iranians in the streets of Tehran and across the country as they protest a radical regime that has brought them nothing but economic downturn and war." </p><p>A parallel statement from the U.S. government’s Persian-language account, @USAbehFarsi, said Washington supports the Iranian people’s efforts "to make their voices heard," urging the Islamic Republic to respect fundamental rights rather than suppress protests.</p><p>Iranian officials acknowledged the unrest but defended the government’s approach. Reuters reported that government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Tehran recognizes protests and that officials would set up a mechanism to engage with protest leaders. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian directed his interior minister to address protesters’ "legitimate demands" and engage in dialogue with their representatives.</p><p>Independent analysts warned the unrest reflects deeper structural strains. The OSINT research group SpecialEurasia said in an assessment on Tuesday that Iran’s internal stability has reached a "critical threshold," citing the convergence of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currency collapse</a>, renewed international sanctions and chronic water and energy shortages. The group noted that the participation of bazaar merchants, traditionally a pillar of regime support, signals declining confidence in the state’s economic management and raises the risk of prolonged unrest.</p><p>NCRI leader Maryam Rajavi said the protests reflect the anger of "tens of millions" driven to the breaking point by inflation, corruption and clerical rule. NCRI’s claims reflect opposition reporting and cannot be independently verified due to restrictions on access inside Iran.</p><p>Cameron Khansarinia, vice president of the National Union for Democracy in Iran, said the latest demonstrations underscore a growing shift in public sentiment. "Iranians have once again taken to the streets." Citing President Donald Trump’s remarks this week, he added that "each time they do, the regime tries to crush it," but argued that "Iranians’ desire to be free is increasingly becoming greater than their fear of the regime." Khansarinia claimed that chants in support of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/exiled-iranian-prince-tells-trump-he-can-one-historys-great-peacemakers-amid-talk-regime-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi</a> have been growing in the protests, saying the protesters showed "remarkable bravery." </p><p>As protests continue, verification of casualties and arrests remains limited, but the scale and spread of the unrest underscore mounting pressure on Iran’s leadership amid economic free fall and growing public defiance.</p>
