<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> on Friday addressed participants in the March for Life, an annual pro-life demonstration in D.C. </p><p>"In 2026, as we celebrate 250 years since our founding fathers recognized the right to life in our Declaration of Independence, I want to thank every single one of you who was out on this winter day," he said.</p><p>Trump recalled that in 2020, he became the first sitting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. president</a> to attend the March for Life, saying he was "proud" to do so. He remarked on the progress the pro-life movement had made since then, noting the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-moves-expand-mexico-city-policy-targeting-abortion-dei-gender-ideology-foreign-aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STATE DEPT MOVES TO EXPAND MEXICO CITY POLICY, TARGETING ABORTION, DEI AND GENDER IDEOLOGY IN FOREIGN AID</strong></a></p><p>The president painted the fight for the pro-life movement as a battle, saying that it was time to bring back a culture that supports life.</p><p>"This is a battle that must be fought, must be won, not only in the corridors of power, but above all, in the hearts and souls of the people," Trump said in a pre-recorded message. "That is why, under the Trump administration, we're strongly defending religious liberty. We're bringing back faith in America. We're bringing back God."</p><p>The Trump administration recently moved to expand the Mexico City Policy, a Reagan-era U.S. rule that conditions foreign aid on recipient groups certifying they will not provide or promote abortion as a method of family planning. </p><p>The expansion of the policy would bar U.S. foreign assistance from subsidizing abortion and, in a major broadening, from supporting what the administration calls gender and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, Fox News Digital learned Thursday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-life-groups-warn-trump-hyde-amendment-non-negotiable-after-flexibility-remarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PRO-LIFE GROUPS WARN TRUMP HYDE AMENDMENT IS 'NON-NEGOTIABLE' AFTER FLEXIBILITY REMARKS</u></strong></a></p><p>In the pre-recorded message, the president spoke about the launch of <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-accounts-explained-who-qualifies-how-work-when-you-can-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump Accounts</a>, which invests $1,000 into accounts for children under the age of 18, painting it as another win for families. The accounts function like long-term investment vehicles and are designed to grow over time. </p><p>Vice President JD Vance made his second appearance at the event, where he also gave an address in 2025. His speech is timely, as he and his wife, second lady Usha Vance, recently announced that they are expecting their fourth child.</p><p>"Now, some of you may remember that in my remarks last year, I told you all that one of the things I most wanted in the United States of America was more families and more babies. So, let the record show you have a vice president who practices what he preaches," Vance told the cheering crowd.</p><p>"Usha and I announced this week that we're expecting our fourth. And it will be our third baby boy. So, we'll take whatever prayers you can give. We certainly need them," he added.</p><p>Vance also celebrated the overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling it "the most important Supreme Court decision of my lifetime." He said that with the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court "put a definitive end to the tyranny of judicial rule on the question of human life." </p><p>The vice president, crediting Trump for the victory, said that the president had helped end a culture "that treated human life as expendable."</p><p>The rally in D.C., which regularly sees massive crowds, takes place every year on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. </p>
