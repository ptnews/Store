You’re going to be Kirked,’" Shirley told host Patrick Bet-David. </p><p>"That’s what they’re saying — like, you’re next. You’ll be the next [Charlie] Kirk," he said.</p><p>Shirley appeared shaken as he described the toll the threats had taken, particularly the calls received by his family.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/questions-remain-licensing-site-crashes-whiplash-ensues-mn-child-care-fraud-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>QUESTIONS REMAIN, LICENSING SITE CRASHES AS WHIPLASH ENSUES IN MN CHILDCARE FRAUD SCANDAL</strong></a></p><p>"And it’s just like, are you kidding me? It’s not even like — I hate what’s happening right now. I honestly feel bad for my family, because it’s like, yeah, we didn’t do anything wrong, and yet you guys are coming after me like I’m some sort of villain," he said.</p><p>He later added, "So I’m like, my little sister is getting phone calls. I’m like, why are you guys doing this?"</p><p>Shirley maintained that his investigation was about financial accountability, not politics.</p><p>"I didn’t make this a right-or-left issue," he said. "I just showed you guys that fraud was happening."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/vp-debate-footage-walz-touting-state-support-daycares-goes-viral-amid-minnesota-fraud-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VP DEBATE FOOTAGE OF WALZ TOUTING STATE SUPPORT FOR DAYCARES GOES VIRAL AMID MINNESOTA FRAUD ALLEGATIONS</strong></a></p><p>As previously reported by Fox News Digital, Minnesota <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/state-officials-daycare-manager-push-back-viral-video-fraud-allegations-minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officials have pushed back</a> on Shirley’s video.</p><p>Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families Commissioner Tikki Brown said past inspections have not uncovered any evidence of fraud.</p><p>"We are aware of a video that’s being circulated that has gained local and national attention about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childcare centers in Minnesota</a>," Brown said during a news conference Dec. 29.</p><p>"While we have questions about some of the methods that were used in the video, we do take the concerns that the video raises about fraud very seriously."</p><p>However, in response to Shirley's video, the U.S. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Health and Human Services</a> announced Dec. 30 that it would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hhs-cuts-off-minnesota-child-care-payments-over-alleged-daycare-fraud-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halt childcare payments</a> to Minnesota.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Shirley for comment.</p>
