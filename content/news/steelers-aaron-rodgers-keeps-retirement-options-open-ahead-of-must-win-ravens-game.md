Whenever the season ends, I'll be a free agent. So that'll give me a lot of options if I still want to play. I mean, not a lot of options, but there'll be options, I would think, maybe one or two, if I decide I still want to play."</p><p>Rodgers' apparent change of heart comes months after he explained why the 2025 season would likely be his last. </p><p>"I’ve played 20 frickin' years, it’s been a long run, and I’ve enjoyed it and what better place to finish than one of the cornerstone franchises in the NFL with [Steelers head coach] Mike Tomlin and a great group of leadership and guys in a city that expects you to win," he said during an appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePatMcAfeeShow" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>"The Pat McAfee Show"</u></a> in June. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/steelers-aaron-rodgers-gives-blunt-reaction-controversial-no-call-loss-browns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>STEELERS' AARON RODGERS GIVES BLUNT REACTION TO CONTROVERSIAL NO CALL IN LOSS TO BROWNS</u></strong></a></p><p>Rodgers has thrown for 3,028 yards with 23 touchdowns and 7 interceptions and has a real shot of making a playoff appearance with a win over Lamar Jackson and the Ravens on Sunday. </p><p>"I hope I can get through this stretch and feel good physically so that's not in the conversation," he added.</p><p>The next hurdle is a must-win game against Baltimore.
