The GoFundMe says he is planning to sue the school for alleged First Amendment violations, and solicits donations from people interested in "fighting racism" and "standing up for free speech."</p><p>"My pups, two cats and I could use your support as we plan for the next steps," he wrote in the post, adding several hashtags including #Project2025 and #DEI.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hamline-university-student-brags-video-that-he-celebrated-charlie-kirk-assassination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HAMLINE UNIVERSITY STUDENT BRAGS ON VIDEO THAT HE CELEBRATED CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION</strong></a></p><p>Perkins was the school's former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/dei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">director of race and equity</a>.</p><p>"UCLA just fired me (Dir. of Race &amp; Equity) over Bluesky posts about not being sad Charlie Kirk died," he said in another post.</p><p>On Sept. 12, two days after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/people-were-listening-prosecutor-says-charlie-kirk-targeted-his-influence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirk was shot and killed</a> while hosting a Turning Point USA event on Utah Valley University's campus, Perkins appeared to suggest in a now-deleted post that Kirk deserved to die.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/tpusa-spokesperson-accuses-arizona-teachers-mocking-charlie-kirks-death-halloween-costumes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TPUSA SPOKESPERSON ACCUSES ARIZONA TEACHERS OF MOCKING CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH WITH HALLOWEEN COSTUMES</strong></a></p><p>"Multiple times throughout his short life, Charlie Kirk has proudly proclaimed the United States' 45,000 or so annual gun deaths are 'worth it' for his beloved <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/second-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2nd Amendment</a> 'right to bear arms,'" he said. "Dude made this bed; reaped what he sowed; chickens coming home to roost, etc. Smh."</p><p>"I'm always glad when bigots die, so," he said in another post.</p><p>"It is OKAY to be happy when someone who hated you and called for your people’s death dies — even if they are murdered," he said in another.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/hawaii-teacher-punished-constitution-day-lesson-free-speech-charlie-kirk-legal-group-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HAWAII TEACHER PUNISHED FOR CONSTITUTION DAY LESSON ON FREE SPEECH, CHARLIE KIRK, LEGAL GROUP SAYS</strong></a></p><p>"F--- Around and Find Out is really doing its thing, lately," said a fourth post.</p><p>UCLA placed Perkins on leave amid the initial wave of controversy.</p><p>"UCLA has placed a campus employee on immediate leave and has launched an investigation following reports of social media posts regarding <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/one-month-after-charlie-kirks-murder-key-questions-remain-unanswered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the murder of Charlie Kirk</a>.
