<p>Leaders from Greenland and Denmark are slated to meet with Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jd-vance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD Vance</a> and Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a> Wednesday at the White House as President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> weighs acquiring Greenland. </p><p>While the Danish territory claims it is seeking independence from Copenhagen, Denmark, and isn’t interested in becoming part of the U.S., Trump repeatedly has stated a desire to secure Greenland for the U.S. as Russian and Chinese presence grows in the Arctic — dating back to his first administration.</p><p>"One way or the other, we are going to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have Greenland</a>," Trump told reporters Sunday. </p><p>Trump voiced similar sentiments Wednesday ahead of the meeting, claiming that the region is critical for the creation of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/golden-dome-missile-shield-tested-trump-key-american-territory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden Dome project</a>, a defense shield initiative for the U.S. akin to the one Israel has protecting itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/european-allies-working-plan-us-acts-acquiring-greenland-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EUROPEAN ALLIES WORKING ON PLAN IF US ACTS ON ACQUIRING GREENLAND: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>"The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/national-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Security,"</a> Trump said in a post on social media Wednesday. "It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building. NATO should be leading the way for us to get it." </p><p>"NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES," Trump wrote. "Anything less than that is unacceptable." </p><p>While Greenland and Denmark have a complicated history due to Denmark’s treatment of indigenous people on the island, Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said that his country prefers aligning itself with Denmark rather than the U.S.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-greenland-push-escalates-gop-lawmaker-moves-make-americas-51st-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP'S GREENLAND PUSH ESCALATES AS GOP LAWMAKER MOVES TO MAKE IT AMERICA'S 51ST STATE</strong></a></p><p>"If we have to choose between the USA and Denmark here and now, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/greenlands-prime-minister-says-we-choose-denmark-over-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we choose Denmark,"</a> Nielsen told reporters Tuesday, according to translated remarks. "We choose NATO, the Kingdom of Denmark and the EU." </p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/federal-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen</a> has said issued <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-greenland-takeover-would-end-nato-denmark-asserts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stern warnings to the Trump administration</a> on the matter. </p><p>"The Kingdom of Denmark — and thus Greenland — is part of NATO and is therefore covered by the alliance’s security guarantee," Frederiksen said in a statement Jan. 4. "We already have a defense agreement between the Kingdom and the United States today, which gives the United States wide access to Greenland." </p><p>"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale," Frederiksen said.</p><p>Greenland is rich in natural resources, including oil and natural gas, and both Russia and China have bolstered their presence in the region in recent years.</p><p>Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland in March, the Department of Defense’s northernmost <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/johnson-no-boots-ground-trumps-greenland-acquisition-plans-amid-military-speculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military installation that houses Space Force’s</a><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/air-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Force’s 821st Space Base Group</a> to conduct missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations.</p>
