<p>The suspect charged with vandalizing the Cincinnati home of Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jd-vance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD Vance</a> was not politically motivated, according to his defense attorney.</p><p>During a court appearance on Tuesday, defense attorney Paul Laufman insisted the actions of 26-year-old William DeFoor "had nothing to do with the specifics of the vice president," and were instead related to mental health.</p><p>"I just don’t think there’s anything political going on. This is purely a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health issue</a>," Laufman said, describing DeFoor as someone who writes "peaceful" poetry.</p><p>A judge set DeFoor’s bond at $11,000 for four non-federal charges of vandalism, criminal trespass, criminal damaging or endangering and obstructing official business.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/federal-prosecutors-charge-suspect-who-allegedly-vandalized-us-attorney-alina-habbas-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FEDERAL PROSECUTORS CHARGE SUSPECT WHO ALLEGEDLY VANDALIZED US ATTORNEY ALINA HABBA’S OFFICE</u></strong></a></p><p>DeFoor was set to appear in federal court later Tuesday on federal charges of damaging government property, engaging in physical violence against any person or property in a restricted building or grounds, and assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vp-vances-ohio-home-damaged-man-in-custody-secret-service-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeFoor is accused</a> of running along the front fence of Vance’s protected residence before breaching the property line at the driveway, according to an affidavit filed Monday. He was allegedly wielding a hammer and attempted to break the driver’s side window of an unmarked federal law enforcement vehicle blocking the driveway entrance.</p><p>DeFoor ignored all commands to stop and drop the weapon, according to charging documents, and used the hammer to break glass windows across the front of the home.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/advocate-warned-afghan-evacuee-not-functional-person-months-before-national-guard-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ADVOCATE WARNED AFGHAN EVACUEE WAS 'NOT FUNCTIONAL AS A PERSON' MONTHS BEFORE NATIONAL GUARD SHOOTING</u></strong></a></p><p>Enhanced security assets on each window were damaged from the hammer strikes. The assets, which are owned by the U.S. government, are valued at more than $28,000, prosecutors said.</p><p>DeFoor allegedly tried to run away before Secret Service agents and Cincinnati <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police officers</a> detained him.</p><p>When DeFoor was arrested, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspect-vance-home-vandalism-has-had-multiple-run-ins-law-demanded-called-julia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he demanded to be called</a> "Julia," FBI sources told Fox News.</p><p>Court records show DeFoor has faced <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple criminal cases</a> in Hamilton County in recent years, with each proceeding intersecting with findings related to his mental competency.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Greg Wehner contributed to this report.</i></p>
