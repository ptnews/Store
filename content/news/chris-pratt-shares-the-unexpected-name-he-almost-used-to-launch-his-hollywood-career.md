"You almost rebranded before the career got going."</p><p>"Just branded," Pratt clarified. "Not even rebranded. Just branded. I was going to be Christo."</p><p>Pratt recalled that the name originated from a nickname that he was given by his coworkers when he worked at the seafood chain restaurant Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/keanu-reeves-hollywood-manager-tried-change-his-name-during-his-early-acting-career" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KEANU REEVES' HOLLYWOOD MANAGER TRIED TO CHANGE HIS NAME DURING HIS EARLY ACTING CAREER</strong></a></p><p>"I had a name tag that said Christopher at Bubblegum Shrimp Co.," Pratt remembered. "But the ‘PHER’ got rubbed off, so it said ‘Christo,’ and everyone called me Christo for a long time while I was working at Bubba Gump."</p><p>"High turnover rate, the new employees thought my name was Christo," he continued. "And as I navigated being discovered and brought to Los Angeles to follow my dreams, part of me thought in earnest maybe I go as just Christo."</p><p>"That's the part of you I like — that thought that," Horowitz said as the two laughed. </p><p>"It’s never too late," Pratt said with a smile.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Pratt has previously shared that he was discovered by actress and director Rae Dawn Chong when he was 19 and waiting tables at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/maui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. in Maui</a>. Chong cast Pratt in the lead role as Jeff in her directorial debut, the 2000 horror-comedy short film "Cursed Part 3." The part was Pratt's first credited acting role and sparked his interest in moving to LA to pursue acting seriously.</p><p>Pratt, whose full name is Christopher Michael Pratt, became internationally famous as "Chris Pratt" and jokingly known among fans as one of the "Hollywood Chrises," which also include actors <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/chris-hemsworth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Hemsworth</a>, Chris Evans and Chris Pine.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Pratt?" Shaw asked. </p><p>"Yep," he said. "Pratt. CP. You know, CP. ‘Hey, CP.’ But no one calls me Chris. My friend, Chad. I went golfing with my friend, Chad, my pastor, the other day, and he was like, ‘No one calls you Chris? I’m gonna call you Chris. All right, Chris. You’re up.’ And I was like, 'No, it feels weird. It’s not my name. Don’t call me Chris.'"</p>
