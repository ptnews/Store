The group also claimed former NRA directors seized control of the foundation to compete with the gun rights organization.</p><p>"The Foundation has been seized by a disgruntled faction of former NRA directors who lost control of the NRA’s Board following revelations of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/corruption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial improprieties</a>, mismanagement, and breaches of fiduciary duty and member trust," attorneys for the NRA wrote in the complaint.</p><p>The attorney claimed that the faction of former directors seeks to use the foundation to reclaim control after having been "booted out of power by the NRA’s members."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/black-lives-matter-leader-okc-charged-wire-fraud-money-laundering-alleged-embezzlement-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BLACK LIVES MATTER OKC LEADER CHARGED WITH WIRE FRAUD, MONEY LAUNDERING IN ALLEGED $3.15M EMBEZZLEMENT SCHEME</strong></a></p><p>The suit claims that the foundation has a personal "beef" with the NRA, and that the faction is "bitter" about losing control of the NRA’s board following "a series of scandals."</p><p>Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s former chief, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wayne-lapierre-announces-resignation-nra-chief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned in January 2024</a> as he was set to face trial in a corruption case brought by Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James.

It also seeks to block conduct that could lead the public to believe the foundation’s activities are "sponsored, endorsed, or authorized by, or associated or connected with" the NRA.</p>
