<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House of Representatives</a> has passed a bill to revive and extend COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies, in a major victory for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.</p><p>17 House Republicans broke ranks with GOP leaders to support the legislation after Democrats were successful in forcing a vote via a mechanism called a privileged resolution.</p><p>A discharge petition is a mechanism for getting legislation considered on the House floor even if the majority's leadership is opposed to it, provided the petition gets a majority of House lawmakers' signatures.</p><p>Jeffries filed the discharge petition late last year, which was then signed by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/four-republicans-buck-mike-johnson-join-hakeem-jeffries-obamacare-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four House Republicans — helping</a> it clinch the critical majority threshold.</p><p>Five more House Republicans joined Democrats in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/9-house-republicans-defy-mike-johnson-join-dems-advance-obamacare-extension-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wednesday evening vote</a> to advance the legislation for final consideration Thursday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-fails-save-obamacare-subsidies-after-shutdown-fight-premiums-set-surge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CONGRESS FAILS TO SAVE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES AFTER SHUTDOWN FIGHT, PREMIUMS SET TO SURGE</strong></a></p><p>It underscores the perilously slim margins that Speaker <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Johnson</a>, R-La., is governing with.</p><p>House Republicans hold just a two-vote majority with full attendance on both sides, numbers that could easily shift when lawmakers are absent for personal or health reasons.</p><p>As Rep.
