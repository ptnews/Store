<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/russell-wilson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russell Wilson</a> went from starting quarterback of the New York Giants to third string just a few weeks into the 2025 season, leaving many to question if the 10-time Pro Bowler decides to play next season.</p><p>Wilson, 37, doesn’t sound like he’s mulling over his decision. He wants to play in 2026.</p><p>"I’m not blinking," Wilson said, <a href="https://x.com/SNYGiants/status/2008189199590056085" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">per SNY</a>. "I know [what] I’m capable of. I think I showed that in Dallas, and I want to be able to do that again, you know, and just be ready to rock and roll, and be as healthy as possible and be ready to play ball."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href="http://FOXNEWS.COM"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Wilson signed a one-year, veteran minimum deal with the Giants this past offseason worth $10.5 million, which had tons of incentives if he were to play the entire season.</p><p>That same offseason, the Giants traded back into the first round to select Jaxson Dart out of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/ole-miss-rebels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ole Miss</a>, and he proved during training camp to have NFL-ready chops under center.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/giants-gm-joe-schoen-losing-season-citing-need-continuity-stability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GIANTS STICK WITH GM JOE SCHOEN DESPITE ANOTHER LOSING SEASON, CITING NEED FOR ‘CONTINUITY AND STABILITY’</strong></a></p><p>Still, then-head coach Brian Daboll was steadfast in his decision to start Wilson despite Dart’s success. But, after just three games, where the Giants went 0-3, a change was made.</p><p>Daboll went with Dart in Week 4 against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-chargers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Chargers</a> at home, and the rookie defeated Justin Herbert and company to not only get his first career win, but cement himself as the team’s starter moving forward.</p><p>Even then, Wilson remained positive<strong>, </strong>saying in interviews after practice that he understands the direction of the team and wanted to help Dart develop and grow in his new role.</p><p>In his three starts for the Giants, Wilson threw for 831 yards with three touchdowns to three interceptions, though all of those touchdowns came in a Week 2 overtime heartbreaker for New York. Over half of Wilson’s passing yards also came in that game, throwing for 450 in the 40-37 loss.</p><p>Wilson also said that he tore his hamstring during that game against the Cowboys.</p><p>"I played that game, you know, I tore my hamstring on Friday in practice – the last play of practice. And I had a Grade 2 (tear). I couldn’t tell anybody. I had to go and play on it just because I knew the circumstance, I had to play on it, no matter what," Wilson explained.</p><p>"I actually ended up going to the Dallas Mavericks’ facility, training. And you know, just kept it quiet, just trying to get treatment on it and just knowing that I probably couldn’t run from the goal line to the 10-yard line if I wanted to, but I feel like… I got to play this game."</p><p>It will be interesting to see if Wilson will land anywhere, and better yet, if a team is willing to try him out as a starter again.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
