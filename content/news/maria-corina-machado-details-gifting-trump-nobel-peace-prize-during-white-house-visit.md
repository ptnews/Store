"It was a very emotional moment."</p><p>Machado explained she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/venezuelan-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-presents-nobel-medal-trump-despite-institute-ban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented the prize</a> to the president on behalf of the Venezuelan people, crediting him for the historic work he did in liberating the country from its dictator Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>"[Venezuelans] appreciate so much what he has done for, not only the freedom of the Venezuelan people, but I would say the whole hemisphere," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-announces-venezuela-turning-over-millions-barrels-oil-us-government-immediately" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ANNOUNCES VENEZUELA TURNING OVER MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL TO US GOVERNMENT 'IMMEDIATELY'</strong></a></p><p>As a long-time Maduro critic, Machado has been vocal in supporting Trump’s unprecedented removal of the disgraced Venezuelan leader, prompting her to credit him with the prize for the historic capture.</p><p>Trump appeared pleased and gratified by Machado's gesture.</p><p>"It was my Great Honor to meet María Corina Machado, of Venezuela, today," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. "María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect."</p><p>Days ago, Machado discussed transferring the prize to Trump during an interview on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/hannity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Hannity,"</a> but <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/nobel-institute-shuts-down-talk-venezuelan-leader-sharing-peace-prize-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the idea was rejected</a> by the Norwegian Nobel Institute last Friday.</p><p>"Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time," the institute wrote in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-us-in-charge-venezuela-he-reveals-hes-spoken-delcy-rodriguez" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP VOWS US 'IN CHARGE' OF VENEZUELA AS HE REVEALS IF HE'S SPOKEN TO DELCY RODRÍGUEZ</strong></a></p><p>While the award cannot be officially transferred, Machado instead gifted it to Trump.</p><p>President Trump has spoken previously about being eligible to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p>On "Hannity," Trump argued he should receive one award for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">each war he has ended</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-says-wont-second-wave-attacks-against-venezuela-due-cooperation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THERE WON'T BE A 'SECOND WAVE OF ATTACKS' AGAINST VENEZUELA DUE TO THEIR 'COOPERATION'</strong></a></p><p>"You know, when you put out eight wars, in theory, you should get one for each war," he told Fox News.</p><p>Machado also opened up about visiting the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> and meeting with Trump on Thursday, nearly two weeks after the United States captured Maduro.</p><p>"It went very well," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she said</a>. "I'm very grateful for the opportunity I had to speak with President Trump. Something I've been looking forward for a very long time."</p><p>"It was a huge responsibility because I did it on behalf of the Venezuelan people," she added.</p><p>Tune in to Fox News on Friday to watch Machado's full interview on "Fox &amp; Friends."</p>
