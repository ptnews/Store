<p>Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that President Donald Trump is under the "thrall of Lindsey Graham" following the U.S. operation in Venezuela, according to audio of the remarks by the lawmaker that MeidasTouch's Acyn Torabi <a href="https://x.com/acyn/status/2008320158469869782?s=46" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">posted on X.</a></p><p>Paul, who ran for president during part of the 2016 presidential election cycle but ultimately dropped out, recalled speaking to the Trump family at a presidential debate, and how they said they liked the Paul family and the concept of not being involved with foreign wars.</p><p>"It was something I liked about Donald Trump," Paul noted, explaining that when he had "misgivings" about Trump, he would "always come back and say, 'Well, he's the best we've ever had'." Paul said he felt, by contrast, that the Bush family were "war mad" and wanted to be involved in "these crazy wars overseas" that they justified as making "the world safe for democracy."</p><p>"And I thought Trump was different. And so it disappoints me," he said, adding that Trump is under the "thrall of Lindsey Graham."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rand-paul-rips-jd-vances-assertion-executing-cartel-members-best-use-our-military" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RAND PAUL RIPS JD VANCE'S ASSERTION THAT EXECUTING CARTEL MEMBERS IS THE ‘BEST USE OF OUR MILITARY’</strong></a></p><p>Paul has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV9dYvzJkhg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> Trump's move to unilaterally depose Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro without seeking congressional approval for the attack as "disdainful." </p><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, a hawkish Republican from South Carolina, has strongly supported the president's action.</p><p>"This is Lindsey Graham. Lindsey Graham has gotten to the president who expressed — I saw a clip — there’s like 20 clips of [Trump] saying he’s not for regime change and how regime change has always gone wrong. Somehow they’ve convinced him it’s different if it’s in our hemisphere," Paul said to reporters Monday, according to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5673949-rand-paul-blames-lindsey-graham/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Hill</a>.</p><p>Torabi also <a href="https://x.com/acyn/status/2008320158469869782?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted audio</a> on X in which Paul can be heard quipping, "There should be a law" stipulating that Graham may only visit the White House "every other week" and may only meet with "mid-level people, not the president.
