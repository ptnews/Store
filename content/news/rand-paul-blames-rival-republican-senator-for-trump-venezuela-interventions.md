<p>Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that President Donald Trump is under the "thrall of Lindsey Graham" following the U.S. operation in Venezuela, according to audio of the remarks by the lawmaker that MeidasTouch's Acyn Torabi <a href="https://x.com/acyn/status/2008320158469869782?s=46" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">posted on X.</a></p><p>Paul said that after the first presidential debate in 2016, the Trump family told him that they liked him and the "idea of not being involved in foreign wars." </p><p>"It was something I liked about Donald Trump," Paul said. "It was one of the things, whenever I had misgivings about something else, I would always come back and say, 'Well, he's the best we ever had.' Much better than the Bush's, who were war mad and wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas... 'We're gonna make the world safe for democracy.' I never liked any of that. And I thought Trump was different, and so, it disappoints me, but he's under the... thrall of Lindsey Graham."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rand-paul-rips-jd-vances-assertion-executing-cartel-members-best-use-our-military" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RAND PAUL RIPS JD VANCE'S ASSERTION THAT EXECUTING CARTEL MEMBERS IS THE ‘BEST USE OF OUR MILITARY’</strong></a></p><p>Paul has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV9dYvzJkhg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">described</a> Trump's move to unilaterally depose Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro without seeking congressional approval for the attack as "disdainful." </p><p>Sen.
