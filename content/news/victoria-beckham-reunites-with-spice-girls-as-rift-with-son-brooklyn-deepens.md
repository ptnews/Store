Rumors of a family rift had been swirling since Brooklyn married Nicola Peltz Beckham in April 2022.</p><p>In a lengthy post on Instagram stories shared on Jan. 19, Brooklyn confirmed he is estranged from his parents, adding, "I do not want to reconcile with my family." In the post, he claimed he had "no choice" but to address the situation publicly, accusing his parents of planting stories and speaking to the press.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

The post also alleges that Victoria "hijacked" his first dance with Nicola and that she purposefully didn't make his wife a wedding dress and only informed the bride shortly before the wedding, leaving her scrambling to find a new dress.</p><p>"I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>overwhelming anxiety</u></a>. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared. I wake up every morning grateful for the life I chose, and have found peace and relief," he wrote.</p><p>Brooklyn's lengthy statement concluded, "My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation. All we want peace, privacy and happiness for us and our future family."</p><p>In addition to Brooklyn, Beckham and David share sons Romeo, 23, and Cruz, 21, along with daughter Harper, 14. </p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Lori A.
