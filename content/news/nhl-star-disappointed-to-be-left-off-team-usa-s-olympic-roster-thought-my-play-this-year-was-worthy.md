<p>USA Hockey unveiled its roster for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olympics</a> Friday, and there were a couple of notable omissions. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nhl/new-york-rangers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Rangers</a> star defenseman Adam Fox and Dallas Stars left winger Jason Robertson were left off the roster. Fox played for the United States in the 4 Nations Tournament last year but struggled. </p><p>Despite his struggles in the 4 Nations tournament, the 27-year-old is still one of the best defensemen in the NHL. The 2020-21 Norris Trophy winner as the NHL’s best defenseman has 28 points in 24 games this season. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Fox has four goals and 24 assists. The three-time All-Star missed 14 games with a shoulder injury, and the Rangers sorely missed their top defenseman, going 6-6-2 in his absence while the power play sputtered without him.</p><p>"Obviously, it's disappointing," Fox said, according to <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/new-york-rangers-adam-fox-not-making-united-states-team-for-winter-olympics-disappointing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NHL.com.</a> "I thought I played as well as I think I could have, and that decision comes out of your hands at a certain point. It is what it is. You just have to move on.</p><p>"I don't think you have any expectation (to make the Olympic team), I would say, but I obviously thought my play this year was worthy of it and my track record as well," Fox said. "But it's out of my hands at a certain point. The decision is the decision, and I guess that's how it goes."</p><p>Robertson was left off the 4 Nations roster last season due to a slow start, but the 26-year-old has gotten off to a strong start this season. In 41 games, Robertson has scored 24 goals and recorded 24 assists, leading fans to believe he could provide Team USA with some top-end scoring.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nhl-deputy-commissioner-doubles-down-olympic-concerns-says-players-wont-go-ice-deemed-unsafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NHL DEPUTY COMMISSIONER DOUBLES DOWN ON OLYMPIC CONCERNS, SAYS PLAYERS 'WON'T GO' IF ICE IS DEEMED UNSAFE</strong></a></p><p>Here is Team USA’s roster: </p><p>Matt Boldy, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nhl/minnesota-wild" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota Wild</a></p><p>Kyle Connor, Winnipeg Jets</p><p>Jack Eichel, Vegas Golden Knights</p><p>Jake Guentzel, Tampa Bay Lightning</p><p>Jack Hughes, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nhl/new-jersey-devils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey Devils</a></p><p>Clayton Keller, Utah Mammoth</p><p>Dylan Larkin, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nhl/detroit-red-wings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detroit Red Wings</a></p><p>Auston Matthews, Toronto Maple Leafs</p><p>J.T.
