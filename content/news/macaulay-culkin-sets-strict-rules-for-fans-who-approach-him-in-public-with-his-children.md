I'm in charge of the interaction," Culkin said. "I can guide this interaction."</p><p>Culkin began his Hollywood career at a remarkably young age, quickly standing out as a gifted child actor in the late '80s. Culkin’s breakthrough came in 1990 with "Home Alone", where his portrayal of the clever and independent Kevin McCallister made him one of the most famous child stars in the world almost overnight.</p><p>Following a recent screening of the iconic holiday movie at the Academy Museum in honor of the film's 35th anniversary, the 45-year-old actor and the movie's director, Chris Columbus, sat down for a Q&amp;A, in which Culkin shared that his two kids are big fans of the movie.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

That looks like Kevin,’" Culkin shared. "I go, ‘Oh, no, nobody, here’s your aunt.'"</p><p>Culkin shared during the Q&amp;A that his perspective on the movie has changed since becoming a father, saying he now resonates with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/new-beetlejuice-movie-trailer-sees-return-original-cast-fresh-new-faces" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Catherine O'Hara's</u></a> character, "seeing how desperately and how hard she's trying to get home" to her son.</p><p>He also shared that since becoming a parent, people always ask him if he watches "Home Alone" <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/family" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with his kids</a>, to which he responds, "Of course, this movie is awesome."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>"But I don't watch the movie, I watch them," he said. "I watch their eyes. I listen to them laugh and things like that. And it makes me really proud to be a part of something like that. So it resonates now. Now I can see it through their eyes."</p><p>He continued: "You guys were raised on it, now you guys are raising your kids on it, right? So, now I'm raising my kids on it. It means something completely different. That's the way <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>I look at the movie</u></a> nowadays."</p>
