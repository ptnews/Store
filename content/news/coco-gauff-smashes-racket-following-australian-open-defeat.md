She took exception to the moment being shown to the viewing audience.</p><p>"Certain moments — the same thing happened to Aryna (Sabalenka) after I played her in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis/us-open-tennis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final of the U.S. Open</a> — I feel like they don’t need to broadcast," Gauff told reporters after the match. "I tried to go somewhere where I thought there wasn’t a camera because I don’t necessarily like breaking rackets.</p><p>"I broke one racket (at the) <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis/french-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Open</a>, I think, and I said I would never do it again on court because I don’t feel like that’s a good representation. So, yeah, maybe some conversations can be had."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/three-time-grand-slam-winner-enjoys-beer-court-after-emotional-final-australian-open-match" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>THREE-TIME GRAND SLAM WINNER ENJOYS BEER ON COURT AFTER EMOTIONAL FINAL AUSTRALIAN OPEN MATCH</strong></a></p><p>She added that it was much better for her to take her frustrations out on the racket than her support staff.</p><p>"They’re good people. They don’t deserve that, and I know I’m emotional," Gauff said. "So, yeah, I just took the minute to go and do that.</p><p>"I don’t think it’s a bad thing. Like I said, I don’t try to do it on court in front of kids and things like that, but I do know I need to let out that emotion."</p><p>Gauff has never won the Australian Open. She made it as far as the semifinals in 2024. She was ousted in the quarterfinals last year.</p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
