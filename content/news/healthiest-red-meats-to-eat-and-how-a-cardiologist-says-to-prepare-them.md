<p>Red meat has reentered the national health conversation thanks to sweeping changes to federal diet guidelines released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).</p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> administration last week unveiled a new upside-down food pyramid as part of the 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. It emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods and places protein, dairy, healthy fats, vegetables and fruit at the top — with refined carbohydrates and grains deemphasized.</p><p>The updated guidelines recommend prioritizing "high-quality, nutrient-dense protein foods as part of a healthy dietary pattern."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/red-meat-can-help-mood-part-healthy-balanced-diet-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RED MEAT CAN HELP YOUR MOOD IF PART OF A HEALTHY, BALANCED DIET, STUDY SUGGESTS</strong></a></p><p>"Consume a variety of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein foods</a> from animal sources, including eggs, poultry, seafood and red meat," the guidance states, while also encouraging "a variety of plant-sourced protein foods, including beans, peas, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds and soy."</p><p>HHS Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/robert-f-kennedy-jr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> said the new guidelines "recognize that whole, nutrient-dense food is the most effective path to better health and lower healthcare costs."</p><p>"Protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines. We are ending the war on saturated fats," Kennedy said.</p><p>The visual grouping of red meat alongside <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fruits and vegetables</a> has drawn attention from some Americans, though health experts caution that the new framework still emphasizes moderation and balance.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/eating-chicken-linked-higher-mortality-rates-observational-study-suggests"><strong><u>EATING CHICKEN LINKED TO HIGHER MORTALITY RATES, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY SUGGESTS</u></strong></a></p><p>Dr. Craig Basman, a cardiologist at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, shared ideas for thoughtfully incorporating red meat into a heart-healthy diet.</p><p>Not all red meat is created equal, Basman told Fox News Digital — and people concerned about heart health should prioritize leaner options.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/how-much-red-meat-too-much-experts-weigh-food-pyramid-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red meat</a> includes beef, pork, lamb, veal, goat and mutton — not poultry or fish.</p><p>"For beef, look for 'loin' or 'round' in the name," Basman said. "For pork, tenderloin and loin chops are leaner choices."</p><p>If you don't have the leanest cut, Basman suggested trimming the fat.</p><p>Cooking methods also matter, Basman said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/techniques/healthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slower cooking methods</a> at lower temperatures are preferred," he said.</p><p>"Baking, broiling, roasting and steaming are excellent choices, as they allow fat to drip away."</p><p>Cooking meat at very high temperatures can pose health risks, according to Basman.</p><p>Grilling and frying at high temperatures, Basman said, "can create harmful compounds, including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs)."</p><p>These compounds have been linked in studies to inflammation and increased risks of heart disease and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certain cancers.</a></p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/techniques/grilling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If you grill</a>, avoid charring the meat and cook at a lower temperature," Basman said.</p><p>Marinating meat can offer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health benefits</a> in addition to flavor, Basman said.</p><p>Acidic marinades made with ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar may help "reduce the formation of harmful compounds" during cooking, Basman said.</p><p>Despite the inclusion of red meat in the new dietary guidance, processed meats remain a concern among cardiologists, Basman said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>Americans should avoid or strictly limit their intake of bacon, sausage, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/hot-dog-towers-budget-friendly-replacement-seafood-towers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot dogs</a> and deli meats, he said.</p><p>"These products are typically very high in sodium and preservatives, both of which are linked to high blood pressure and 'bad' cholesterol, which may increase the risk of heart disease," Basman said.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/health-experts-react-andrew-huberman-backs-trump-admins-new-food-pyramid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new food pyramid</a> allows for red meat as part of a healthy dietary pattern, it should "be eaten less often and in smaller portions," Basman said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"For <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart health,</a> it's best to mix red meat with healthier protein choices like poultry, fish and plant-based proteins such as beans, lentils and nuts," he said. </p><p>"Aim to make fish or plant proteins your main choices most days, use poultry regularly and save red meat for occasional meals."</p><p>Balancing protein sources can help "lower saturated fat intake and support healthy cholesterol levels," Basman added — while still allowing flexibility and enjoyment in everyday eating.</p>
