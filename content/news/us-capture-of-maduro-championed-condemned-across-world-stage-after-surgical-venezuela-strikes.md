<p>World leaders were sharply divided Saturday after the United States launched a large-scale strike on Venezuela and President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> announced that the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, had been captured and flown out of the country.</p><p>Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez condemned what he called a "criminal attack," <a href="https://x.com/DiazCanelB/status/2007359344829141372" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">writing on X</a> that, "Our zone of peace is being brutally assaulted." Communist Cuba is a supporter of the Maduro government and has been a longtime adversary of the United States.</p><p>Other allies, including Colombian President Gustavo Petro,, said his government viewed the reports coming out of Venezuela "with deep concern," and he warned against further escalation, claiming the U.S. strikes risked destabilizing the region.</p><p>"The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/latin-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombian Government</a> rejects any unilateral military action that could aggravate the situation or put the civilian population at risk," Petro <a href="https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/2007356950514729388?s=46&amp;t=W6aKtwyMOcQWAmZKlmQo3w" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote on X.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-coast-guard-pursues-third-dark-fleet-oil-tanker-trump-targets-venezuelan-sanctions-evasion-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US COAST GUARD PURSUES THIRD 'DARK FLEET' OIL TANKER AS TRUMP TARGETS VENEZUELAN SANCTIONS EVASION NETWORK</strong></a></p><p>Petro said Colombia is taking preventive measures to "protect the civilian population" and "preserve stability on the Colombian-Venezuelan border," although he did not provide exact details.</p><p>Mexico also condemned the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, saying it was a "clear violation" of international law and urging an end to what it described as "any acts of aggression" against Venezuela.</p><p>"Latin America and the Caribbean is a zone of peace," a <a href="https://www.gob.mx/sre/prensa/mexico-condena-intervencion-militar-en-venezuela?state=published" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement released</a> by the Mexican foreign ministry reads. The statement was shared by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on X.</p><p>It warned that any military action puts regional stability at "serious risk."</p><p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also blasted the military action, saying the bombings and the reported capture of its president crossed "an unacceptable line."</p><p>"These acts represent a most serious affront to Venezuela’s sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community," Lula <a href="https://x.com/LulaOficial/status/2007436536590012845" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>, warning the strike risked plunging the world into "violence, chaos, and instability."</p><p>Russia, too, criticized the strikes, calling them an act of "armed aggression" against Venezuela. Moscow warned the move risked further escalation and urged dialogue instead.</p><p>"Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it proclaimed itself in 2014. Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny, free from any destructive — let alone military — external interference," the Russian government said in a <a href="https://t.me/MFARussia/27937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>. </p><p>China said it was "deeply shocked" by the U.S. action. </p><p>"China is deeply shocked and strongly condemns the U.S.'s blatant use of force against a sovereign state and its action against its president," Beijing's foreign ministry said in a <a href="https://x.com/MFA_China/status/2007460580089868702" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a>. "Such hegemonic behavior by the U.S. seriously violates international law, infringes upon Venezuela's sovereignty, and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean. China firmly opposes it," it added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran’s Foreign Ministry</a> also condemned the strikes.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Javier Milei of Argentina, a close ally of Trump, praised the news by sharing a previous video of him denouncing Maduro's "narco-terrorist" regime as a regional threat and urging Latin American leaders to back U.S. pressure to end it.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-targets-maduros-inner-circle-family-major-narco-state-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TARGETS MADURO’S INNER CIRCLE, FAMILY IN MAJOR NARCO-STATE CRACKDOWN</strong></a></p><p>"Long live freedom, dammit!" Milei wrote, using his signature pro-freedom chant.</p><p>Gideon Sa'ar, Israel's minister of foreign affairs, also commended the operation and hailed Trump for acting "as the leader of the free world."</p><p>"In this historic moment, Israel stands with the freedom-loving Venezuelan people, who have suffered under the illegal tyranny of Maduro," Sa'ar <a href="https://x.com/gidonsaar/status/2007478022123725166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> on X. "Israel celebrates the removal of the dictator who led a network of drugs and terrorism and hopes that democracy returns to the country and friendly relations between the states. The people of Venezuela deserve to exercise their democratic rights. South America deserves a future free from the axis of terrorism and drugs."</p><p>In Europe, European Council President António Costa said he was following developments in Venezuela "with great concern," urging de-escalation and respect for international law.</p><p>"The European Union calls for de-escalation and a resolution in full respect of international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations," Costa said, adding that the bloc would continue to support a "peaceful, democratic, and inclusive solution" in Venezuela.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the U.K.</a>, Reform leader and staunch Trump ally Nigel Farage questioned the legality of the attack but said it may lead to a favorable outcome.</p><p>"The American actions in Venezuela overnight are unorthodox and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/international-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contrary to international law</a> — but if they make China and Russia think twice, it may be a good thing," Farage wrote. "I hope the Venezuelan people can now turn a new leaf without Maduro.</p><p>Meanwhile, in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuela,</a> the government called on citizens to mobilize against what it labeled an "imperialist attack," urging, "People to the streets!"</p><p>Regional reaction elsewhere in Latin America was muted in the early hours after the strike, with several governments remaining silent as uncertainty grew over who was in control in Caracas.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
