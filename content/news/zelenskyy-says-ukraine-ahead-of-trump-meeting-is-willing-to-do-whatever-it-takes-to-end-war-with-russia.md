<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> declared Saturday that his country "is willing to do whatever it takes" to end its war with Russia ahead of a meeting Sunday in Florida with President Donald Trump.</p><p>In a series of posts on X, the Ukrainian leader said, "If the whole world – Europe and America – is on our side, together we will stop Putin," but, "if anyone – whether the U.S. or Europe – is on Russia’s side, this means the war will continue."</p><p>"There are no other options here. And this is a risk for all countries in the world. Because Russia will not stop, regardless of any agreements, any eloquent messages from them. They will not stop at Ukraine," Zelenskyy warned. He is set to meet with Trump in Florida on Sunday, where Zelenskyy said he will share a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-us-near-20-point-peace-deal-putin-spurns-zelenskyy-christmas-ceasefire-offer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-point peace proposal</a> to end the conflict with Russia. </p><p>The posts came after Russia launched a fresh overnight attack against Kyiv involving hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles. Zelenskyy said the attack put the "true attitude" of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle on display.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/zelenskyy-says-he-meet-trump-before-new-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ZELENSKYY SAYS HE WILL MEET WITH TRUMP 'BEFORE THE NEW YEAR' </strong></a></p><p>The overnight blitz in Ukraine’s capital left at least one person dead and 27 injured, local authorities told The Associated Press. </p><p>"Another Russian attack is still ongoing: since last night, there have been almost 500 drones – a large number of ‘shaheds’ – as well as 40 missiles, including Kinzhals. The primary target is Kyiv – energy facilities and civilian infrastructure," Zelenskyy wrote on X on Saturday morning. "Regrettably, there have been hits, and ordinary residential buildings have been damaged. Rescuers are searching for a person trapped under the rubble of one of them." </p><p>"There have been many questions over the past few days – so where is Russia’s response to the proposals to end the war offered by the United States and the world? Russian representatives engage in lengthy talks, but in reality, Kinzhals and ‘shaheds’ speak for them. This is the true attitude of Putin and his inner circle," Zelenskyy added. "They do not want to end the war and seek to use every opportunity to cause Ukraine even greater suffering and increase their pressure on others around the world."</p><p>Zelenskyy also said Saturday that, "If Russia turns even the Christmas and New Year period into a time of destroyed homes and burned apartments, of ruined power plants, then this sick activity can only be responded to with truly strong steps." </p><p>"The United States has this capability. Europe has this capability. Many of our partners have this capability. The key is to use it," he declared. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-officials-tout-progress-talks-reach-lasting-durable-peace-between-ukraine-russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US OFFICIALS TOUT PROGRESS IN TALKS TO REACH 'LASTING AND DURABLE PEACE' BETWEEN UKRAINE, RUSSIA </strong></a></p><p>Zelenskyy added in another X post later Saturday morning, "Ukraine did not start this war. Russia started it."</p><p>"Ukraine supported President Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire. Ukraine has agreed to many different compromises, and this is documented in our draft agreements, in our 20-point plan. Ukraine is willing to do whatever it takes to stop this war. For us, priority number one – or the only priority – is ending the war," Zelenskyy continued.</p><p>"For us, the priority is peace. We need to be strong at the negotiating table. To be strong, we need the support of the world: Europe and the United States. And this includes air defenses – which are currently insufficient, weaponry – which is currently insufficient, and money – thankfully, there is now a European decision, but, frankly, there is a constant shortage of funds, in particular for the production of weapons and, most importantly, drones," he said.</p><p>Trump, ahead of the meeting with Zelenskyy, has said he will <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-suggests-hell-call-final-shots-peace-deal-ahead-zelenskyy-meeting-well-see-what-hes-got" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call the final shots</a> on a peace deal to end the conflict.</p><p>"He doesn’t have anything until I approve it," Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/26/trump-to-politico-zelenskyy-doesnt-have-anything-until-i-approve-it-00706783" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told Politico Friday.</a> "So we’ll see what he’s got." </p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian Defense Ministry</a> said Saturday that it had carried out a "massive strike" overnight, using "long-range precision-guided weapons from land, air, and sea, including Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles" and drones, on energy infrastructure facilities "used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces," as well as "Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises." </p><p>The ministry said the strike came in response to Ukraine’s attacks on "civilian objects" in Russia.</p><p>Earlier on Saturday, the ministry said its air defenses shot down seven Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Krasnodar and Adygeya overnight. </p><p>"Contrary to President Trump’s expectations and despite the readiness to make compromises by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Russia attacked again Kyiv’s residential districts," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X. "I will speak today about the chances for peace with the leaders of Ukraine, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, and the EU."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Diana Stancey and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i> </p>
