<p><strong>EXCLUSIVE: </strong>Maryland's lone House Republican is pledging to take Democratic leaders in his state to court if they follow through on plans that could see him booted out of Congress next year.</p><p>Lawmakers in the Old Line State's House of Delegates are set to take the first step toward drawing a new congressional map on Tuesday afternoon, which, if passed, would give Democrats an edge in every district in the state.</p><p>Currently, just one House Republican represents <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of Maryland</a> — House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/redistricting-battles-brewing-across-country-parties-compete-power-ahead-2026-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>REDISTRICTING BATTLES BREWING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS PARTIES COMPETE FOR POWER AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS</strong></a></p><p>When asked about Democrats pushing the move last week, Harris took aim at Maryland Gov. Wes Moore's Redistricting Advisory Commission.</p><p>"His partisan gerrymandering commission certainly lived up to its name," Harris told Fox News Digital with a laugh. "They literally drew the district across a five-mile-long Bay Bridge to go into two other pieces of two other different counties."</p><p>Harris pointed out that even Maryland's Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/maryland-gov-wes-moore-brushes-off-top-state-democrats-warning-redistricting-possibly-backfiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized the new map</a> when it was released last week.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-urges-supreme-court-block-california-map-calls-newsom-backed-plan-racial-gerrymander" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOJ URGES SUPREME COURT TO BLOCK CALIFORNIA MAP, CALLS NEWSOM-BACKED PLAN A RACIAL GERRYMANDER</strong></a></p><p>"Look, the Senate president called it, and I quote, objectively unconstitutional. So Wes, we’ll see you in court," the conservative caucus leader said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Moore is set to testify before a committee in the Annapolis State House on Tuesday, after which the panel will vote on whether to send the new map to the full House of Delegates for a vote.</p><p>He met with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., at the U.S. Capitol last week to discuss the issue.</p><p>Maryland is the latest state wading into the redistricting war that has gripped the country.</p><p>It began last year when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas' GOP-led legislature</a> pushed through a new congressional map that could give Republicans as many as five new seats in the House of Representatives come the November midterms.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California quickly</a> followed suit with its own successful referendum to redraw its maps in favor of Democrats.</p><p>Democrats in Virginia are now eyeing ways to make their congressional map more favorable to Democrats, and North Carolina Republicans approved a new map late last year that would imperil the state's lone House Democrat.</p>
