We live in a time of great consequence with the Middle East on the verge of previously unimaginable change. Standing together and following through on our commitments only makes us stronger," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lindsey-graham-calls-us-use-any-means-necessary-stop-people-behind-killing-iranians" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LINDSEY GRAHAM CALLS FOR US TO USE ‘ANY MEANS NECESSARY’ TO STOP THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE KILLING OF IRANIANS</strong></a></p><p>Graham's announcement comes less than a month after he met with Netanyahu in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Israel</a> in December.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/2002716710420594849" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> posted to X on December 21, Netanyahu welcomed the senator, calling Graham "a great friend of Israel" and "great personal friend."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/graham-suggests-trump-help-iran-protesters-military-cyber-psychological-attacks-against-regime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GRAHAM SUGGESTS TRUMP ‘HELP’ IRAN PROTESTERS WITH ‘MILITARY, CYBER AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTACKS’ AGAINST REGIME</strong></a></p><p>The lawmaker has been advocating for U.S. President Donald Trump to attack <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Iran</a>.</p><p>"President Trump's resolve is not the question: Question is, when we do an operation like this, should it be bigger, or smaller?
