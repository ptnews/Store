<p>New York City’s new subway fare gates are drawing mockery online, as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/viral-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viral videos show riders</a> easily bypassing the barriers.</p><p>What began as isolated stunts has escalated into an online trend, with some influencers dubbing it a "Fare Evasion Olympics." Clips of the stunts have racked up millions of views across social media platforms.</p><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/09/us-news/rock-climber-takes-home-gold-in-middle-of-the-night-fare-evasion-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Post reported</a> on a group that staged a late-night competition, taking running jumps over the fare gates at Manhattan’s Broadway-Lafayette St. station. The winner was awarded a check for $3, the cost of a subway ride.</p><p>"It’s still incredibly beatable. It’s not really effective, it’s just expensive," said Danny Fisher, who organized the "Fare Evasion Olympics" last week.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mamdani-struggles-explain-how-hell-fund-free-buses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MAMDANI STRUGGLES TO EXPLAIN HOW HE'LL FUND FREE BUSES</strong></a></p><p>In late 2025, the <a href="https://www.mta.info/project/modern-fare-gates" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MTA first launched three new gate designs</a> in 20 stations, rather than their usual turnstiles. One of the new gate designs is expected to be rolled out at 150 stations across the city over the next few years. The fare-beating program is expected to cost New Yorkers $1.1 billion.</p><p>Brooklyn influencer @officialkiingspiider has posted videos showing riders bypassing the MTA’s new gates, which have drawn millions of views.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/road-ahead-transit-new-york-city-2026-includes-fare-hikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>THE ROAD AHEAD FOR TRANSIT IN NEW YORK CITY IN 2026 INCLUDES FARE HIKES</strong></a></p><p>In one clip posted Tuesday, the influencer is seen slipping through the gate blindfolded while using a cane as part of the stunt. Another video, posted several weeks earlier, shows him walking through the gate as another rider exits. That video surpassed 18 million views on Instagram.</p><p>The Brooklyn native <a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/mtas-new-fare-evasion-video-viral-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told FOX 5 New York,</a> "We need to focus more on like safety and the service of the subway system. A lot of people are getting hurt."</p><p>He also said the MTA is wasting millions of dollars on the new gates and that those involved in filming the stunts remain respectful during <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interactions with police.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/mamdani-confronted-the-view-over-appointee-who-called-homeownership-weapon-white-supremacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MAMDANI CONFRONTED ON 'THE VIEW' OVER APPOINTEE WHO CALLED HOMEOWNERSHIP 'WEAPON OF WHITE SUPREMACY'</strong></a></p><p>The MTA defended the rollout, telling FOX 5 NY, "This is a free pilot program with technology from leading companies in the world, and so far most riders seem to like it."</p><p>"The opinions of minor-league trolls who steal rides from New Yorkers for internet attention are less of a concern," they added.</p><p>Fare and toll evasion cost the MTA roughly $1 billion in lost revenue in 2024, according to a report from the <a href="https://cbcny.org/research/no-fare#fourpronged" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Citizens Budget Commission in Sept.</a></p>
