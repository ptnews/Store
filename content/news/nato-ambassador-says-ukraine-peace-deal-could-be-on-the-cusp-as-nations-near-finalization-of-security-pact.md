<p>Negotiations over <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security guarantees for Ukraine</a> may be nearing a breakthrough. </p><p>U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said allied nations are close to locking in a framework that would pave the way for a peace deal with Russia during an appearance on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-friends-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Fox &amp; Friends First"</a> as talks begin in Paris.</p><p>"What we should expect is really a finalization of a couple of agreements. One is the Coalition of the Willing, which is about 50 allied countries, many of them in NATO are going to agree to a certain security framework for Ukraine," he said Tuesday. </p><p>"And so is the United States, both as part of that Coalition of Willing and separately."</p><p>This agreement could pave the way for a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6387161032112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final peace deal with Russia</a>. </p><p>"We're really very far down the road. This is a great development, and we could be on the cusp of a peace deal," Whitaker added. "While we continue to pray for peace, we're also doing all the hard work to make sure we can sustain that peace."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-russia-crossroads-how-war-evolved-2025-what-comes-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UKRAINE–RUSSIA AT A CROSSROADS: HOW THE WAR EVOLVED IN 2025 AND WHAT COMES NEXT</strong></a></p><p>The United States will be represented by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p><p>Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a> will be absent due to obligations related to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, a move Whitaker called "a big win for the United States of America and the security of the Western Hemisphere."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/zelenskyy-reacts-maduro-arrest-us-knows-what-do-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ZELENSKYY REACTS TO MADURO ARREST: US 'KNOWS WHAT TO DO NEXT'</strong></a></p><p>Whitaker framed the operation as a piece of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader deterrence strategy</a>, saying it sends a clear message to U.S. foes.</p><p>"Any adversary of the United States should be concerned about what they saw," Whitaker said. </p><p>"It demonstrated capabilities that no other country can execute. And at the same time, it demonstrates that the United States, when the president says something, when we draw a red line, that we're willing to enforce that with our power."</p><p>He pointed to Operation Midnight Hammer, a U.S. military strike carried out in June 2025<strong>,</strong> aimed at crippling <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran’s nuclear program</a>, as another instance of Trump backing up his words with action.</p><p>"That, to me, is what ensures peace through strength," Whitaker said.</p>
