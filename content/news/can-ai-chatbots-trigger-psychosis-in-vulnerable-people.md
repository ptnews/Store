<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artificial intelligence</a> chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.</p><p>Doctors stress this does not mean <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatbots cause psychosis.</a> Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/faith-deficit-artificial-intelligence-should-alarm-every-american" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OPINION: THE FAITH DEFICIT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD ALARM EVERY AMERICAN</strong></a> </p><p>Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delusions in susceptible individuals.</a> In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.</p><p>Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating. </p><p>For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.</p><p>Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.</p><p>Mental health professionals say the timing of symptom escalation matters. When delusions intensify during prolonged chatbot use, AI interaction may represent a contributing risk factor rather than a coincidence.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/openai-tightens-ai-rules-teens-concerns-remain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN</u></strong></a></p><p>Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further investigation.</a></p><p>A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled <i>"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health"</i> examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states: <i>"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI." </i>The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.</p><p>OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.</p><p>Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.</p><p>Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations. Family members and caregivers should also pay attention to behavioral changes tied to heavy chatbot engagement.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/i-contestant-the-bachelor-heres-why-ai-cant-replace-real-relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>I WAS A CONTESTANT ON ‘THE BACHELOR.’ HERE’S WHY AI CAN’T REPLACE REAL RELATIONSHIPS</u></strong></a></p><p>Mental health experts stress that most people can interact with AI chatbots without problems. Still, a few practical habits may help reduce risk during emotionally intense conversations.</p><p>If emotional distress or unusual thoughts increase, experts say it is important to seek help from a qualified mental health professional.</p><p><strong>Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?</strong></p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?

For most people, they remain helpful tools. For a small but important group, they may unintentionally reinforce harmful beliefs. Doctors say clearer safeguards, awareness and continued research are essential as AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives. Understanding where support ends and reinforcement begins could shape the future of both AI design and mental health care.</p><p>As AI becomes more validating and humanlike, should there be clearer limits on how it engages during emotional or mental health distress?
