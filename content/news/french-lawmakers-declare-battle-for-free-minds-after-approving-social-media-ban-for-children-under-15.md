<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French</a> lawmakers have backed a bill banning social media for children under 15 in what one legislator likened to a "battle for free minds."</p><p>The bill, which also bans mobile phones in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/high-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high schools</a>, passed late Monday by a 130–21 vote. The bill will now head to the Senate for discussion before a final vote.</p><p>"With this law, we are setting a clear boundary in society and saying social media is not harmless," French lawmaker Laure Miller told the assembly.</p><p>"Our children are reading less, sleeping less and comparing themselves to one another more," she continued. "This is a battle for free minds."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-family-sues-character-ai-after-chatbot-allegedly-encouraged-teen-harm-parents-himself" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEXAS FAMILY SUES CHARACTER.AI AFTER CHATBOT ALLEGEDLY ENCOURAGED AUTISTIC SON TO HARM PARENTS AND HIMSELF</strong></a></p><p>Macron has pushed lawmakers to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/macron-says-childrens-brains-not-sale-urges-fast-track-ban-social-media-kids-under-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast-track the legislation</a> so that the ban could be in place in time for the start of the next academic year in September.</p><p>"Banning social media for those under 15: this is what scientists recommend, and this is what the French people are overwhelmingly calling for," Macron said after the vote. "Because our children’s brains are not for sale — neither to American platforms nor to Chinese networks. Because their dreams must not be dictated by algorithms."</p><p>The idea of setting a minimum age for use of the platforms has gained momentum <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across Europe</a>.</p><p>The vote comes days after the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British government</a> said it is considering similar restrictions as it tightens rules to protect children from harmful online content and excessive screen time.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/protecting-kids-from-ai-chatbots-what-guard-act-means" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS</u></strong></a></p><p>Australia introduced a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/australia-removes-4-7m-kids-from-social-media-platforms-first-month-historic-ban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world-first ban</a> on social media for children under 16 years old in December, restricting access to platforms such as Facebook, TikTok and YouTube.</p><p>France’s health watchdog reports that one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/smartphones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a smartphone</a>. A December report found that about 90% of children ages 12 to 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% using them for social media.</p><p>The agency warned of links between heavy social media use and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced self-esteem</a>, as well as increased exposure to content tied to risky behaviors, including self-harm, drug use and suicide.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Bonny Chu and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
