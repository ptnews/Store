<p>A chaotic scene unfolded at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/auburn-tigers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auburn University</a> on Tuesday night as a wild buzzer-beater was waved off well after the Tigers had celebrated on their own court.</p><p>With 0.6 seconds remaining and Auburn trailing 90-88, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KeShawn Murphy</a>, somehow left wide open, caught an inbounds pass and nailed a long 3-pointer for what was thought to be the game-winner.</p><p>However, officials went to the scorer’s table to review the play, which was awfully close.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>Ultimately, officials ruled that the shot had not gone off in time, ending the Tigers' celebration and prompting one from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/texas-am-aggies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas A&amp;M</a>.</p><p>The officials quickly made themselves public enemy number one and were showered with debris from fans on their way off the court. At least one referee needed his head to be covered.</p><p>One fan sitting courtside even turned his back and threw his drink over his shoulder aimed at an official.</p><p>"They didn't say a word. They just said it was no good and ran off the floor.
