<p>You finish a drink <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/bars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the bar,</a> friends arrive and a table opens. </p><p>You grab your glass, head to the dining room and ask a simple question: "Can you transfer my tab?"</p><p>For bartenders, that routine request can come with an unexpected cost.</p><p>"Logistically, it's not difficult," said Dawn Kenney, owner of Players Locker Room, a sports bar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and restaurant</a> in Jacksonville, Florida. "Our software is actually very capable of switching who's serving them."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/americans-fed-up-tipping-culture-many-shelling-out-20-restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AMERICANS ARE FED UP WITH TIPPING CULTURE, YET MANY STILL SHELL OUT 20% AT RESTAURANTS</strong></a></p><p>Modern point-of-sale systems, she told Fox News Digital, can move checks between bartenders and servers with just a few clicks.</p><p>But ease doesn't mean it's not problematic, especially when it comes to tips.</p><p>While a tab can be transferred, tips often can't be easily divided once service changes hands.</p><p>"We do not have our system set up to where it's easy for us to split tips," Kenney added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/bar-owner-sparks-outrage-after-mocking-customer-while-defending-ban-solo-drinkers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BAR OWNER SPARKS FURY OVER 'NARROW-MINDED,' CONTROVERSIAL LATE-NIGHT ENTRY POLICY</strong></a></p><p>That gap between service and compensation is where frustration can creep in, particularly for bartenders who've already put in the time.</p><p>Taylor Lowry, a bartender at Grease <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/spirits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whiskey bar</a> and restaurant in West Palm Beach, Florida, said transferring a tab can mean losing out entirely.</p><p>"We also lose the tip on that check, which is frustrating if [the customers] have been at the bar a while," she told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Because not all systems function the same way, the experience can vary widely from one bar to the next.</p><p>"Some systems don't allow you to transfer checks," she said.</p><p>Industry norms have developed to smooth over those differences.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/gen-z-drinkers-leave-bartenders-frustrated-shrinking-tips-terrible-trend-emerges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GEN Z DRINKERS LEAVE BARTENDERS FRUSTRATED WITH SHRINKING TIPS AS 'TERRIBLE' TREND EMERGES</strong></a></p><p>At Kenney's bar, time spent matters more than the request itself.</p><p>"If the person's been sitting there for a couple of hours, usually I let them — the bartender or server, whoever — say, 'Hey, can I close you out?'" she said.</p><p>On the other hand, she said, "If you just sat down and started your first drink, just transfer it.
