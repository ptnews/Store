<p>A CNN panel erupted on Monday night after a conservative commentator called out the Minnesota lieutenant governor for appearing to wear a hijab. </p><p>Minnesota Democratic Lt. Gov. and U.S. Senate candidate Peggy Flanagan appeared on a Somali TV station wearing what appears to be a hijab at a mall as a widespread fraud scandal <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-reviews-citizenship-cases-from-somalia-other-high-risk-countries-possible-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implicating some Somali</a> residents plagues the state.</p><p>"The Somali community is part of the fabric of the state of Minnesota," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-senate-candidate-wears-hijab-visit-somali-market-fraud-scandal-unfolds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flanagan said,</a> looking into the camera.</p><p>For Muslim women, wearing a headscarf known as a hijab is typically a sign of obedience to God and worn to show modesty. Flanagan is a divorced and remarried Catholic who supports socially liberal policies like transgender identity for children and abortion rights. The contrast between wearing conservative Muslim garb with socially liberal policies became a contentious segment on "CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-fears-of-being-labeled-racist-helped-provide-cover-for-the-exploding-minnesota-fraud-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>HOW FEARS OF BEING LABELED 'RACIST' HELPED 'PROVIDE COVER' FOR THE EXPLODING MINNESOTA FRAUD SCANDAL</u></strong></a></p><p>"The catering to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-reviews-citizenship-cases-from-somalia-other-high-risk-countries-possible-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somali community</a> that goes on by the Democrats in Minnesota is a little weird, is it not?" Scott Jennings asked. "They’ve got the lieutenant governor up there dressed like the Handmaid’s Tale."</p><p>Jennings was referring to Margaret Atwood’s "The Handmaid’s Tale," a<i> </i>dystopian novel about life under a totalitarian theocracy in which a class of women is forced to bear children amid a fertility crisis. Liberal protesters often wear the modest outfit with its red robes and bonnet as a visual shorthand to warn that America is about become <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/handmaids-tale-showrunners-say-shows-warning-ignored-re-electing-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that same type of dystopia.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-dem-senate-candidate-faces-call-from-opponent-to-apologize-over-viral-pandering-hijab-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Why do they cater to them?"</a> Jennings asked. "It's such a small portion of the population. Democrats put them at the center of everything." </p><p>CNN host Abby Phillip balked at comparing the hijab to the handmaids' outfits.</p><p>"I don't think it would be acceptable for you to make a statement like that about Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn. Why on earth is it acceptable to make a statement like that about people —," Phillip responded. </p><p>"It's a White liberal woman dressing in [a hijab]," Jennings interjected.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/somali-fraud-probe-minnesota-underscores-growing-warnings-cash-reaching-extremists" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SOMALI FRAUD PROBE IN MINNESOTA UNDERSCORES GROWING WARNINGS ON CASH REACHING EXTREMISTS</u></strong></a></p><p>"You’re denigrating the religious practices of a group for no reason," Phillip argued.</p><p>"She's not religious," Jennings said.</p><p>A spokesperson representing Flanagan responded by telling Fox News Digital, "While the lieutenant governor was showing her support for small businesses and communities being terrorized by ICE, she was handed a scarf by a friend and briefly wore it out of respect. The real outrage should not be a scarf, but masked men throwing American citizens into vans and violating the Constitution."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</u></strong></a></p>
