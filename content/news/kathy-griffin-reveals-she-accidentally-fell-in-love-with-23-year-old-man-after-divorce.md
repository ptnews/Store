<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kathy-griffin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kathy Griffin</a> is sharing how she found love again after her divorce from her husband.</p><p>The 65-year-old comedian opened up about her love life in an article for <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/comedian-kathy-griffin-dating-after-60-love-sex-aging.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Cut</a>, explaining she first tried dating apps after her friend, Sia, dared her to. She recalled going on three dates, noting they were "very nice guys, and while I did not get the feels for any of them, it was worth it."</p><p>Eventually, Griffin said she was thrown a curveball.</p><p>"I accidentally fell in love with a 23-year-old," she said. "Because of his age, he didn’t have the usual sexism, misogyny and biases that guys my age tend to have. He seemed to see me. I know that sounds really corny. Oh God, it sounds so lame. But I felt really comfortable with him, and I felt very content just hanging out."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jessica-simpson-says-shes-into-younger-men-having-fun-after-splitting-from-husband-eric-johnson" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JESSICA SIMPSON SAYS SHE'S 'INTO YOUNGER MEN' AND HAVING FUN AFTER SPLITTING FROM HUSBAND ERIC JOHNSON</strong></a></p><p>While she knew from the beginning their relationship wouldn't last due to their age difference, she explained, "It was nice to know that my heart could still feel like that in my 60s," adding she was "glad that we were able to capture it for a little while."</p><p>Griffin was married to Matt Moline from 2001 to 2006. She then married marketing executive Randy Bick in 2020, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/divorce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filing for divorce</a> in December 2023.</p><p>"I knew he was too young when he told me he never wanted to have kids and that he could be with me forever," she explained. "And I was like, 'You don’t know that. You’re 23. You have no idea.' I just wouldn’t do that to him. I mean, when I was 23, I thought I knew a lot of s---, but I didn’t. So, I had to set that dove free."</p><p>The "Suddenly Susan" added that the young man "touched my heart" and came into her life at a time when she thought "men suck" and was left wondering, "Why do I pick the worst ones?"</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Things turned around for her when she met this guy, whom she said made her "feel sexy and special and smart and funny."</p><p>"It had a lot of the elements of what I think would’ve made a real, lasting relationship," Griffin said. "He hadn’t been banged around that much. He’s so young that he didn’t have this baggage. And I just knew that my baggage was gonna get in the way."</p><p>Griffin went viral in November 2025 for sharing how much she spent on her third facelift while on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7ulsUN_pM&amp;list=PL23jUKX11QbRFxx7TW2tlp-K6K9VnG2St&amp;index=3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"Good Guys</a>" podcast, saying there are plastic surgeons charging $1 million per facelift.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kathy-griffin-reveals-shocking-price-tag-third-facelift-65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Her facelift</a>, however, was considerably cheaper, telling the hosts, "I'm just such a money person.
