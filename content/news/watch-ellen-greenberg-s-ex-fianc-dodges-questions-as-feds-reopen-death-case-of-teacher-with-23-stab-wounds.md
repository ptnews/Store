<p>The former fiancé of Ellen Greenberg was reportedly spotted on the streets of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City</a> just days after it emerged that the investigation into the Philadelphia teacher’s death has been reopened by federal authorities. </p><p>Sam Goldberg, 43, was seen wearing a black jacket, gray sweatpants and beanie as he departed his $1.88 million Manhattan apartment, which he shares with his wife and two children, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15467971/Ellen-Greenberg-suicide-case-Sam-Goldberg-investigation-family.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>according to</u></a> the Daily Mail. </p><p>Goldberg reportedly remained tight-lipped and refused to answer questions regarding the news that federal prosecutors have recently moved to reopen the investigation into the 2011 death of Greenberg, who was found with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/teachers-23-stab-wound-death-ruled-suicide-again-despite-expert-claims-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 stab wounds.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ellen-greenbergs-controversial-death-ruled-suicide-again-new-report-deeply-flawed-says-lawyer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ELLEN GREENBERG’S CONTROVERSIAL DEATH RULED SUICIDE AGAIN, NEW REPORT ‘DEEPLY FLAWED’ SAYS LAWYER</strong></a></p><p>"It's very good news in that it takes things out of the state of Philadelphia, which we cannot trust, and places it in the hands of the federal government," Greenberg's mother, Sandee Greenberg, told the Daily Mail. </p><p>"There's been so much corruption they need fresh eyes on it," she added. "It's been a very long time coming. January 26 will be 15 years but we're gaining momentum and Ellen knows." </p><p>The case made headlines after Goldberg discovered 27-year-old Greenberg with over 20 stab wounds covering her body, including to the back of her head and her heart. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ellen-greenbergs-parents-vow-fight-for-justice-12-years-after-brutal-stabbing-ruled-suicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ELLEN GREENBERG'S PARENTS VOW TO KEEP UP FIGHT FOR JUSTICE 12 YEARS AFTER BRUTAL STABBING RULED SUICIDE</strong></a></p><p>The circumstances surrounding Greenberg’s death have fueled debate for years, with investigators pointing to the fact that her body was discovered inside a locked apartment that had been forced open by Goldberg after she failed to respond.</p><p>Her death was initially ruled a homicide, but reclassified as a suicide in 2011 when assistant medical examiner Dr. Marlon Osbourne changed the manner of death after meeting with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/philadelphia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philadelphia Police</a> investigators.</p><p>Goldberg has never been named a suspect or been accused of any crime in connection to Greenberg’s death.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-suicide-designation-woman-20-stab-wounds-bruises-ignores-homicide-evidence-experts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PHILADELPHIA SUICIDE DESIGNATION FOR WOMAN WITH 20 STAB WOUNDS, BRUISES, IGNORES HOMICIDE EVIDENCE: EXPERTS</u></strong></a></p><p>Following the release of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/documentary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hulu documentary</a> shedding fresh light on the case in October 2025, Goldberg said that he had been "screwed over" by the film, including his 911 call when he found his fiancée’s body, in which he told authorities she "fell on a knife." </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxTrueCrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X</strong></a></p><p>"Yeah I have been.
