<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> said the U.S. launched airstrikes in northwest Nigeria on Christmas night targeting ISIS militants he accused of killing Christians, calling the operation decisive and warning further attacks would follow if the violence continues.</p><p>"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISIS Terrorist Scum</a> in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!" Trump said Thursday on Truth Social. </p><p>"I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was. The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.</p><p>"Under my leadership, our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper," he continued. "May God Bless our Military, and MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, including the dead Terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/genocide-cant-ignored-gop-lawmaker-backs-trumps-threat-military-action-nigeria" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>‘GENOCIDE CAN’T BE IGNORED’: GOP LAWMAKER BACKS TRUMP’S THREAT OF MILITARY ACTION IN NIGERIA</u></strong></a></p><p>U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) confirmed the attacks in a post on X on Thursday night.</p><p>"At the direction of the President of the United States and the Secretary of War, and in coordination with Nigerian authorities, U.S. Africa Command conducted strikes against ISIS terrorists in Nigeria on Dec. 25, 2025, in Sokoto State," the post read.</p><p>U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz also weighed in after learning about the strikes on ISIS forces in Nigeria.</p><p>"Merry Christmas to the Christians in Nigeria and around the world who know tonight that the President of the United States will fight for them," he said in a post on X.</p><p>Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Thursday, "I commend President Trump, Secretary Hegseth, and our brave troops for these strikes against bloodthirsty ISIS savages who are not only persecuting Christians, but also have killed many Americans."</p><p>Last month, Trump threatened to "do things in Nigeria that Nigeria is not going to be happy about" and "go into that now disgraced country guns-a-blazing."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-targets-anti-christian-violence-new-visa-crackdown-policy-following-nigeria-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ADMIN TARGETS ANTI-CHRISTIAN VIOLENCE WITH NEW VISA CRACKDOWN POLICY FOLLOWING NIGERIA ATTACKS</strong></a></p><p>That warning set the stage for the Christmas-night strikes, which Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said fulfilled the president’s demand that the killings stop.</p><p>"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end," Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said on X. "The<a href="https://x.com/DeptofWar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u> @DeptofWar</u></a> is always ready, so ISIS found out tonight — on Christmas. More to come…</p><p>"Grateful for Nigerian government support &amp; cooperation," he added. "Merry Christmas!"</p><p>Then, nearly a month later, the Trump administration rolled out a new visa-restriction policy in response to a wave of brutal anti-Christian attacks in Nigeria, targeting those accused of orchestrating religious violence against Christians in the West African nation and around the world.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trumps-warning-nigeria-offers-hope-nations-persecuted-christians" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP’S WARNING TO NIGERIA OFFERS HOPE TO NATION'S PERSECUTED CHRISTIANS</u></strong></a></p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the policy in the Immigration and Nationality Act will allow the State Department to deny visas to those "who have directed, authorized, significantly supported, participated in, or carried out violations of religious freedom." </p><p>Immediate family members may also face visa restrictions in some cases.</p><p>"The United States is taking decisive action in response to the mass killings and violence against Christians by radical Islamic terrorists, Fulani ethnic militias, and other violent actors in Nigeria and beyond," Rubio said in the statement.</p><p>The move followed a surge of attacks on Christians and Christian institutions in Nigeria. Last month, gunmen stormed the Christ Apostolic Church in Eruku, Kwara State, killing two people and kidnapping dozens. The 38 abducted worshipers were freed nearly a week later.</p><p>Days later, armed attackers raided St. Mary’s School in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Niger State</u></a>, abducting more than 300 students and staff. School officials said 50 students aged 10 to 18 escaped in the following days, but 253 students and 12 teachers remain captive.</p><p>The violence prompted Trump to designate Nigeria a "country of particular concern," though the Nigerian government disputes the U.S. assessment.</p><p>"I’m really angry about it," the president told Fox News Radio last month. "What’s happening in Nigeria is a disgrace."</p><p>Echoing Trump’s warning, Rubio said earlier this month, "As President Trump made clear, the ‘United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria and numerous other countries.’"</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.</i></p>
