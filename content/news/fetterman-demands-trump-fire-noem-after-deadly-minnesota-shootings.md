John Fetterman, D-Pa., has called upon President Donald Trump to fire Department of Homeland Security Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristi-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Noem</a>.</p><p>In a Tuesday post on X, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/john-fetterman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic senator</a> from Pennsylvania accused Noem of "betraying" the department's central mission.</p><p>Tagging the @POTUS and @realDonaldTrump accounts on X, Fetterman <a href="https://x.com/SenFettermanPA/status/2016134093256200369" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">declared</a>, "I make a direct appeal to immediately fire @Sec_Noem."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fetterman-urges-minneapolis-ice-op-stand-down-city-spirals-ungovernable-dangerous-levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FETTERMAN URGES MINNEAPOLIS ICE OP TO STAND DOWN AS CITY SPIRALS TO ‘UNGOVERNABLE AND DANGEROUS’ LEVELS</strong></a></p><p>"Americans have died. She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy. DO NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary," the senator warned.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the <a class="c-link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House</a> regarding Fetterman's new plea and was referred to comments made by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday.</p><p>"Secretary Noem still has the utmost confidence and trust of the president of the United States," Leavitt said.  Noem is "continuing to oversee the entire Department of Homeland Security and all of the immigration enforcement that's taking place across the whole entire country," Leavitt <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2015857478559264818?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>. "Of course, Secretary Noem is also in charge of FEMA and we are in the wake of a brutal winter storm where hundreds of thousands of Americans have been impacted by that."</p><p>Unlike other Democratic senators, Fetterman typically takes a more pragmatic stance toward Trump and the broader GOP on issues including immigration and border security. In recent weeks, Fetterman had encouraged his party to avoid calls to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-opposes-shutdown-efforts-democratic-colleagues-move-block-ice-funding-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FETTERMAN OPPOSES SHUTDOWN EFFORTS AS DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES MOVE TO BLOCK ICE FUNDING BILL</strong></a></p><p>As the Trump administration has been having federal authorities crack down on illegal immigrants around the U.S., the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minnesota have sparked controversy this month.</p><p>"Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti should still be alive.

I also believe there needs to be a path to citizenship for those hardworking families who are here," Fetterman said in the statement.</p><p>But he also reiterated that he opposes the idea of abolishing ICE.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p><p>"I reject the calls to defund or abolish ICE.
