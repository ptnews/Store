He is serving a 30-year prison sentence after reaching a plea deal with the Champaign County State’s Attorney.</p><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has also charged him with possessing a false Social Security card, possessing a false permanent resident card, making a false statement on a bank application and false use of a passport.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/illegal-immigrant-killed-my-daughter-leftists-march-renee-not-katie" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT KILLED MY DAUGHTER — LEFTISTS MARCH FOR RENEE, NOT FOR KATIE</strong></a></p><p>His entry into the U.S. was littered with problems, Abraham said, pointing to the lack of background and health screenings, as he cited court transcripts and documents noting that Cucul-Bol had HIV.</p><p>Abraham went on to accuse blue state leaders of enabling illegal immigration to inspire the Trump administration to take large-scale action and "deflect" from what is happening in their states.</p><p>"They don't want to cooperate [with the federal government]," he said.</p><p>"They want to have all this kind of chaos to deflect from what's happening in the state, because really the only people that think the state is running well are the people that actually run the state."</p><p>Abraham's remarks come amid widespread tensions between federal authorities and anti-ICE agitators following the death of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good earlier this month <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Minneapolis.</a></p><p><i>Fox News' Emma Bussey contributed to this report.</i></p>
