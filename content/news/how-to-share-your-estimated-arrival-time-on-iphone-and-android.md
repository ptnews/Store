<p>Sharing your estimated time of arrival (ETA) lets others know when to expect you without constant check-ins. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Maps</a> and Google Maps both include built-in tools that send live arrival updates while you drive. Once turned on, the updates run automatically. That means fewer distractions and safer trips.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

It lets contacts know you are on your way and see your updated arrival time in real time. It also adds peace of mind during late nights, long routes or unfamiliar areas. Most importantly, you stay focused on moving safely instead of responding to messages.</p><p>We tested these steps using an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> running iOS 26.2 and a Samsung Galaxy Android phone running Android 16. Make sure Apple Maps or Google Maps is installed and updated to the latest version.</p><p>Before starting navigation, confirm that Apple Maps has the correct permissions. Without these settings enabled, ETA sharing may never appear.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/android-emergency-live-video-gives-911-eyes-scene" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ANDROID EMERGENCY LIVE VIDEO GIVES 911 EYES ON THE SCENE</u></strong></a></p><p>Follow these steps to share your live ETA with a contact using Apple Maps. Note: ETA sharing only works after navigation begins. You also need Location Services enabled for Maps and Contacts.</p><p>Once navigation starts, <strong>tap the route card at the bottom</strong> of the screen to expand it.</p><p>Android users can share their ETA just as easily with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps.</a> You can share your live arrival time on any Android phone using Google Maps. The feature is built into the Google Maps app.</p><p><i>Menu wording or placement may vary slightly depending on your device and Android version.</i></p><p>Your contact can follow your live location and see updated arrival times until you reach your destination or stop sharing.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you don't see "Share trip progress," make sure navigation has already started.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/holiday-travel-privacy-risks-how-stay-safe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>HOLIDAY TRAVEL PRIVACY RISKS AND HOW TO STAY SAFE</u></strong></a></p><p>Once sharing is active, both apps handle updates automatically.</p><p>You can stop sharing at any time from the navigation screen. </p><p><strong>Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?</strong></p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?
