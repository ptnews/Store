"Countless iconic performances, you've worked with every great director, you've won three Golden Globes, an Oscar, and the most impressive thing is that you were able to accomplish that all before your girlfriend turned 30."</p><p>"I mean, that's just insane," Glaser said before apologizing.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/leonardo-dicaprio-rare-affection-girlfriend-intimate-outing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LEONARDO DICAPRIO SHOWS RARE AFFECTION WITH GIRLFRIEND DURING INTIMATE OUTING</strong></a></p><p>"Leo, I'm sorry I made that joke," she said. "It's cheap. I tried not to, but, like, we don’t know anything else about you, man. There’s nothing else. Open up! I’m serious! I looked! I searched!

Otherwise, just disappear as much as you possibly can."</p>
