<p>Newly released police records show that 10-year-old Rebekah Baptiste pleaded for help months before <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she was allegedly killed</a> by her father and his girlfriend in Arizona, revealing an earlier abuse report that was closed despite documented injuries.</p><p><a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/rebekah-baptiste-begged-help-months-before-alleged-murder-report-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to FOX 10 Phoenix,</a> a Phoenix police report details a 911 call made from a local gas station in October 2024, roughly nine months before Rebekah was found unresponsive. The report states the child approached a gas station clerk and begged for help, prompting officers to respond.</p><p>Police wrote that Rebekah told officers her father’s girlfriend, Anicia Woods, had hit her with a brush and a belt as punishment and forced her to run laps and endure other physical discipline for "acting out," the outlet reported. Officers documented visible injuries, and Rebekah was taken to Phoenix Children’s Hospital, where she was treated for a bloody lip and bruising on her hands and feet, according to the report.</p><p>Despite the child’s statements and her injuries, investigators closed the case after her father, Richard Baptiste, and Woods told police the injuries were self-inflicted, the outlet reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/911-calls-gruesome-police-report-details-dark-timeline-arizona-girls-tragic-death" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>911 CALLS, POLICE REPORT DETAILS DARK TIMELINE TO ARIZONA GIRL'S TRAGIC DEATH</strong></a></p><p>Rebekah was later found unresponsive on July 27, 2025, near a remote campsite outside <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concho, Arizona</a>, where investigators say the family had been living off-grid in a yurt without electricity or running water after relocating from Phoenix earlier that month. The family slept on thin mattresses on the floor and hauled water in plastic jugs from a convenience store roughly 15 miles away, according to investigators.</p><p>A 36-page probable-cause affidavit from the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office detailed what detectives described as escalating abuse and repeated attempts by Rebekah to flee. Records show the girl had previously jumped out of a window while living in Phoenix and made multiple escape attempts after the move to Concho, including the day she was taken to the hospital.</p><p>Despite Rebekah’s visible physical decline, including being too weak to drink from a straw, Woods, who claimed to have a background in nursing, told investigators she believed the girl "would be fine" and did not seek immediate medical care.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-melodee-buzzard-body-found-girls-mother-taken-into-custody-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MISSING MELODEE BUZZARD’S BODY FOUND, GIRL’S MOTHER TAKEN INTO CUSTODY: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>When first questioned, both Woods and Baptiste denied knowing what caused Rebekah's condition, suggesting she may have fallen. Medical professionals later found extensive signs of abuse, including a brain hemorrhage, burn marks, missing toenails and hair, and numerous cuts and bruises, according to investigators.</p><p>Previously reviewed 911 calls from July 27 show Woods referring to Rebekah as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her daughter</a> and claiming she was providing rescue breaths, though dispatchers noted she had not begun chest compressions and hesitated to place the child on firm ground, citing nearby rocks. Emergency crews later arrived, but Rebekah did not survive her injuries and was pronounced dead days later at Phoenix Children’s Hospital.</p><p>Investigators wrote that when Baptiste was shown what one detective described as "horrendous photos" of his daughter’s injuries, he "lacked in expressing any emotion." The detective added it would have been impossible for a parent not to notice the extent of the child’s injuries.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/charge-against-melodee-buzzard-mom-dismissed-ankle-monitor-removed-fbi-hunts-missing-9-year-old" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CHARGE AGAINST MELODEE BUZZARD’S MOM DISMISSED, ANKLE MONITOR REMOVED AS FBI HUNTS FOR MISSING 9-YEAR-OLD</strong></a></p><p>Authorities say Baptiste later admitted to striking Rebekah with a belt as punishment for running away, though he denied causing her head injuries. Detectives also reported finding bloody clothing inside the family’s tent that had been changed before emergency services were contacted.</p><p>Both Baptiste and Woods are now facing first-degree <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">murder and multiple child abuse charges</a>, including allegations involving Rebekah’s two younger siblings. Prosecutors have also alleged Rebekah suffered ongoing physical and sexual abuse.</p><p>Concerns about the children’s safety had been raised repeatedly before Rebekah’s death. School officials at Empower College Prep reportedly contacted Arizona’s Department of Child Safety (DCS) at least 12 times over two years, including after Rebekah’s unexplained absence from school, according to prior reporting.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-at-risk-girl-melodee-buzzard-mom-appears-court-after-alleged-box-cutter-standoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MISSING ‘AT-RISK’ GIRL MELODEE BUZZARD’S MOM APPEARS IN COURT AFTER ALLEGED BOX-CUTTER STANDOFF</strong></a></p><p>Rebekah was remembered by the school, where she attended for two years, in a tribute posted on its Facebook page the day after Christmas. School officials described her as intelligent, compassionate and a natural leader, noting she earned the Star Wolfpack award for exemplifying the school’s core values.</p><p>In her honor, the school planted a tree with pink flowers, surrounded by a rock garden made from stones created by staff and students, and displayed a decorative crane donated by a staff member. The school said the tributes allow students and staff to remember her life each day.</p><p>DCS has since launched a review into whether the agency failed to adequately protect the child. Gov. Katie Hobbs has also pledged to fully investigate the case amid growing public scrutiny.</p><p>State Sen. Carine Werner has cited Rebekah’s case as part of a broader failure within Arizona’s child protection system, calling the deaths of three children with prior DCS contact a "wake-up call." </p><p>Werner said a September stakeholder meeting, part of a multiphase review process, included testimony from families, tribal representatives and child welfare experts as lawmakers weigh possible reforms.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to DCS and Phoenix police.</p>
