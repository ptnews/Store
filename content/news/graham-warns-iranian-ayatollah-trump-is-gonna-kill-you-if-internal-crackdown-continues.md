<p>Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lindsey-graham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsey Graham</a>, R-S.C., warned Iran's leader that President Donald Trump will "kill" him if the Iranian regime continues to kill protesters in the country.</p><p>Graham made the stark threat during a Tuesday night appearance on Fox News, referencing the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-regime protests</a> raging in Iran. As of Wednesday, at least 36 people have been killed and more than 2,000 have been detained in the unrest.</p><p>"To the people of Iran: We stand with you tonight," Graham told host Sean Hannity. "We stand for you taking back your country from the Ayatollah, a religious Nazi who kills you and terrorizes the world."</p><p>"And to the Ayatollah: You need to understand, if you keep killing your people who are demanding a better life, Donald J. Trump is gonna kill you," he continued.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-brink-protesters-move-take-two-cities-appeal-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN ON THE BRINK AS PROTESTERS MOVE TO TAKE TWO CITIES, APPEAL TO TRUMP</strong></a></p><p>"Help is on the way," he added in a message for Iranian citizens.</p><p>Graham's comments come amid a heated back-and-forth between Trump and the ayatollah's regime.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-protests-turn-deadly-anti-regime-demonstrations-enter-fifth-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>IRAN PROTESTS TURN DEADLY AS ANTI-REGIME DEMONSTRATIONS ENTER FIFTH DAY</u></strong></a></p><p>The president wrote on Truth Social, "If Iran shoots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go."</p><p>Trump's warning took on a new meaning for Iran following the historic U.S. mission in Venezuela that led to the capture and extradition of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.</p><p>The head of Iran's military threatened preemptive action in response to Trump's "rhetoric" on Tuesday. Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami made the threat while speaking to military academy students, saying, "The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Islamic Republic</u></a> considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response."</p><p>"I can say with confidence that today the readiness of Iran’s armed forces is far greater than before the war. If the enemy commits an error, it will face a more decisive response, and we will cut off the hand of any aggressor," he continued.</p>
