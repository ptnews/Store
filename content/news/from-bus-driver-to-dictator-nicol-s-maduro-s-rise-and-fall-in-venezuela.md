<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuelan dictator</a> captured by the Trump administration worked as a bus driver and union organizer before his ascent through the South American country’s political system, where he ultimately became a wanted man by the U.S. with a $50 million reward for information leading to his arrest. </p><p>Nicolás Maduro was "captured and flown out of the country" early Saturday following a "large-scale strike" by the U.S. military, according to President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Donald Trump</u></a>. </p><p>The actions mark a stunning fall for Maduro, who was serving his third term as president of Venezuela. He led an administration that grappled with economic challenges, mass protests, disputed election results and allegations of narco-trafficking. </p><p>Maduro was born in Venezuela’s capital of Caracas on Nov. 23, 1962. As a young man, he was sent to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/cuba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>communist Cuba</u></a> in 1986 for a year of ideological instruction — his only studies after high school.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/us-strikes-venezuela-maduro-captured-january-3-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIVE UPDATES: TRUMP CONFIRMS OVERNIGHT STRIKES IN VENEZUELA, SAYS US HAS ‘CAPTURED’ MADURO</strong></a></p><p>Upon returning home, Maduro found work as a bus driver and union organizer. He embraced the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez after the then-army paratrooper in 1992 staged a failed coup against an unpopular austerity government. Around the same time, he met his longtime partner, Cilia Flores, a lawyer for the jailed leader. </p><p>After Chávez was freed and elected president in 1998, Maduro, a young lawmaker, helped push his agenda of redistributing the OPEC nation’s oil wealth and political power. </p><p>In 2000, Maduro was elected to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Venezuela’s National Assembly</u></a>. He later became the president of the National Assembly in 2005.</p><p>Then in 2006, Chávez appointed Maduro as Venezuela’s foreign minister. Six years later, Maduro was appointed as Venezuela’s vice president. </p><p>When Maduro took power in 2013 following his mentor’s death from cancer, he struggled to bring order to the grief-stricken nation. Without "El Comandante" in charge, the economy entered a death spiral — shrinking 71% from 2012 to 2020, with inflation topping 130,000% — and opponents and rivals inside the government saw an opportunity. </p><p>Less than a year into Maduro's presidency, hardliner opponents launched demonstrations demanding his exit.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/venezuela-arrests-more-americans-trump-ramps-pressure-maduro-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VENEZUELA ARRESTS MORE AMERICANS AS TRUMP RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON MADURO: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>Leaning heavily on Venezuela’s security forces, Maduro crushed the protests. However, with supermarket shelves empty amid widespread shortages, they resumed with more intensity three years later, leaving more than 100 people dead. In 2018, the International Criminal Court initiated a criminal investigation into possible crimes against humanity. </p><p>The crackdown continued into the 2018 presidential race, which the opposition boycotted when several of its leaders were barred from running. Dozens of countries led by the U.S. condemned Maduro’s first re-election as illegitimate and recognized Juan Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly, as Venezuela’s elected leader. </p><p>"Since 2019, more than 50 countries, including the United States, have refused to recognize Maduro as Venezuela’s head of state," the State Department said in a <a href="https://www.state.gov/nicolas-maduro-moros" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">profile of Maduro on its website.</a></p><p>"Maduro helped manage and ultimately lead the Cartel of the Suns, a Venezuelan drug-trafficking organization comprised of high-ranking Venezuelan officials. As he gained power in Venezuela, Maduro participated in a corrupt and violent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/narco-terror" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>narco-terrorism conspiracy</u></a> with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization," it added.  </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/treasury-targets-oil-traders-tankers-accused-helping-maduro-evade-u-s-sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TREASURY TARGETS OIL TRADERS, TANKERS ACCUSED OF HELPING MADURO EVADE US SANCTIONS</strong></a></p><p>"Maduro negotiated multi-ton shipments of FARC-produced cocaine; directed the Cartel of the Suns to provide military-grade weapons to the FARC; coordinated with narcotics traffickers in Honduras and other countries to facilitate large-scale drug trafficking; and solicited assistance from FARC leadership in training an unsanctioned militia group that functioned, in essence, as an armed forces unit for the Cartel of the Suns," the State Department continued. </p><p>"In March 2020, Maduro was charged in the Southern District of New York for narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices," it also said.</p><p>Maduro was re-elected again in 2024 in another disputed election. </p><p>"Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela’s July 28 presidential election," then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/blinken-venezuelan-nicolas-maduro-lost-election-before-claiming-victory-no-supporting-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said at the time. </a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-hit-big-facility-latin-america-drug-fight" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP SUGGESTS US HIT ‘BIG FACILITY’ IN VENEZUELA DRUG FIGHT</strong></a></p><p>Maduro then delivered a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-president-maduro-inauguration-41df1203ab06e1ee9168622d12aac461" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fiery inauguration speech</a> in January 2025, likening himself to a biblical David fighting Goliath and accusing his opponents and their supporters in the U.S. of trying to turn his inauguration into a "world war." </p><p>He said his enemies’ failure to block his inauguration to a third six-year term was "a great victory" for Venezuela’s peace and national sovereignty. </p><p>"I have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America," he said, after being draped with a sash in the red, yellow and blue of Venezuela’s flag. "I come from the people, I am of the people, and my power emanates from history and from the people. And to the people, I owe my whole life, body and soul." </p><p>Months later, Attorney General <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pam-bondi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Pam Bondi</u></a> announced a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest.</p><p>"Maduro uses foreign terrorist organizations like TdA (Tren de Aragua), Sinaloa and Cartel of the Suns (Cartel de Soles) to bring deadly violence to our country," Bondi said in a video message in August 2025. "He is one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world and a threat to our national security." </p><p><i>Fox News’ Michael Sinkewicz, Lucas Y.
