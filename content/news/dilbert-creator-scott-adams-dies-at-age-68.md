<p>"Dilbert" cartoonist Scott Adams has died at the age of 68, his former wife announced on his show Tuesday morning.</p><p>"He’s not with us anymore," Shelly Miles told listeners. </p><p>Earlier this month, Adams shared a health update on his podcast "Real Coffee with Scott Adams."</p><p>"I talked to my radiologist yesterday, and it’s all bad news — the odds of me recovering are essentially zero," he said. "I’ll give you any updates if that changes, but it won’t."</p><p>"So there’s no chance that I’ll get my feeling back in my legs, and I’ve got some <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing heart failure</a>, which is making it difficult to breathe sometimes during the day," the cartoonist continued. "However, you should prepare yourself that January will probably be a month of transition, one way or another."</p><p>Adams first announced his prostate cancer diagnosis on his show in May, saying that he was in pain every day and had been using a walker for months.</p><p>"If you're wondering if I'll get better, the answer is no, it will only get worse," he said at the time. "There's only one direction this goes."</p><p>Adams was a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, standing out in the creative class with his fervent backing.</p><p>Adams began writing and illustrating the Dilbert comic strip in 1989.
