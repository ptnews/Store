I feel very lucky to have been doing this at the same time as you. I said this 10 years ago, when you were on the show, when I was in Chicago, I saw you on stage at Second City, and you blew my mind, and you were the kind of person that I wanted to do what you were doing. You’ve been really inspirational to me for a very long time. And I’m really grateful to know you, and to both be your colleague and friend. You’re a very special person, so I just want to say thank you," Meyers said.</p>
