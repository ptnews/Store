<p>Former President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> could be pulling in a hefty, taxpayer-funded pension — stemming from his expansive career as a federal employee, according to a new report. </p><p>The National Taxpayer Union Foundation estimates that Biden could be collecting up to a $417,000 pension — more than he was making a year as president, and more than previous presidents — as a result of collecting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pensions from several retirement programs</a> he qualifies for after starting his career in Washington in the 1970s. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-oversight-probes-whether-american-retirees-pension-funds-weaponized-progressive-playbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOUSE OVERSIGHT PROBES WHETHER AMERICAN RETIREES' PENSION FUNDS ARE BEING WEAPONIZED: 'PROGRESSIVE PLAYBOOK'</strong></a></p><p>"It’s pretty unusual, historically unusual, to have such a large pension amount," National Taxpayer Union Foundation President Demian Brady told the <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/us-news/bidens-pension-is-largest-of-any-us-president-in-history/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post</a>. </p><p>The estimate comes from Biden’s long-term career in politics, meaning he has the capability to receive benefits under the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Former President’s Act</a> of 1958, and retirement benefits from the Civil Service Retirement System for his time as a senator and vice president.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-suggests-doj-owes-him-money-past-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP SUGGESTS DOJ OWES HIM MONEY FOR PAST CASES </strong></a></p><p>The Former President’s Act of 1958 stipulates that presidential pensions are equal to the salaries Cabinet secretaries receive, which is currently set at $250,600. Additionally, Biden could be eligible for up to $166,374 for his time as a senator and vice president under the Civil Service Retirement System, Brady told the Post. </p><p>Still, it’s unclear if Biden will actually cash in on all of those benefits. A spokesperson for Biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.</p><p>Biden launched his career as a U.S. senator in 1972, and served as former President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barack Obama</a>’s vice president for eight years starting in 2009. He earned $400,000 a year annually while president. </p><p>The National Taxpayer Union Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. </p><p>Meanwhile, efforts are underway <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Congress</a> to curb how much former presidents can rake in once they leave office. For example, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, reintroduced the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act in 2025, which<strong> </strong>would cap presidential pensions at $200,000<strong>. </strong>The legislation was referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. </p><p>Past initiatives to rein in presidential pensions have failed. Obama ultimately vetoed a similar piece of legislation that Congress backed in 2016 just before he was set to leave the White House. </p>
