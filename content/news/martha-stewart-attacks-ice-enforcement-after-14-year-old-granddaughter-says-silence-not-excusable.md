Things must and have to change quickly and peacefully."</p><p>The star noted beneath the photo statement: "Granddaughter Jude wrote me a note yesterday I took it to heart and posted the above."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/martha-stewart-reveals-unconventional-end-of-life-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MARTHA STEWART REVEALS UNCONVENTIONAL END-OF-LIFE PLAN</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

An immigrant who changed the face of music and left his legacy in a light that continues to shine. Happy birthday, Ed," adding a heart emoji.</p><p>Fans applauded Bertiinelli for highlighting Eddie being an immigrant, with one person writing, "Love that you highlighted that he was an immigrant for those who don't understand how much immigrants add to the fabric of USA."</p><p>Another commenter wrote, "Happy birthday to one of the millions of immigrants who made America more beautiful in many ways! God bless the memory of Ed and all who gave us so much glorious life and creativity in a free country!"</p><p>"Such a beautiful post Valerie. I can't imagine how difficult &amp; scary it was for Eddie &amp; Alex to come to a strange place being so young and &amp; not knowing English. Eddie's an icon who put smiles on fan's faces across the world for decades. Eddie you'll always be missed and loved," a fan penned, to which Bertinelli liked the comment.</p><p>Her son Wolfgang also wrote: "Love you, Ma," adding a heart emoji.</p>
