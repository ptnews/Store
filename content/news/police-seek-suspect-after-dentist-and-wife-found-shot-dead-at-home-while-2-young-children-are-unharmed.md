"He is always on time and he would contact us if there is any issues whatsoever…we're very, very concerned because this is very out of character and we can't get in touch with his wife, which is probably the more concerning thing."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mom-shoots-family-dead-home-before-killing-herself-spares-toddler-ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MOM SHOOTS FAMILY DEAD AT HOME BEFORE KILLING HERSELF, SPARES TODDLER: AG</u></strong></a></p><p>In a separate 911 call from one of Spencer's friends who went to their home, the caller said, "there's a body."</p><p>"We just came here and he appears dead.

"I can tell he's obviously not breathing or anything."</p><p>In a statement on Facebook, Athens Dental Depot said Spencer will be "deeply missed."</p><p>"It is with heavy hearts that we share the sudden passing of our dear colleague and friend, Dr. Spencer Tepe, as well as his wife Monique. He will be deeply missed by our team and the many patients he cared for over the years.

She was an excellent baker, a thoughtful planner, and someone who found joy in bringing people together. Her kindness made people feel instantly at home," the statement said.</p><p>Their relationship was "beautiful, strong and deeply happy" and they built a life "rooted in love," the family said, adding that Spencer and Monique enjoyed taking care of their two children and their pet Goldendoodle.</p><p>"We are heartbroken beyond words. While no outcome can ever undo this loss, our family is committed to seeing this tragedy fully and fairly brought to justice, and to honoring Spencer and Monique by protecting the future of the children they loved so deeply," the statement concluded.</p><p>Rob Misleh, Spencer's brother-in-law, told WSYX that the couple was going to celebrate their five-year anniversary next month after getting married in 2021.</p>
