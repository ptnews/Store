<p>The felony-convicted husband of progressive "squad" lawmaker <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/squad-member-ayanna-pressley-announces-decision-challenging-ed-markey-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.,</a> slapped a phone out of a reporter's hands Monday inside a city hall building after they attempted to approach the congresswoman to ask her a question about alleged childcare fraud in Minnesota. </p><p>"Congresswoman Pressley, do you support –" the interviewer could be heard asking as he approached Pressley with his phone camera on record before Conan Harris, Pressley's husband who spent <a href="https://pressley.house.gov/2020/03/04/appeal-ayanna-pressleys-husband-spent-10-years-prison-now-he-and-pressley-are/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">10 years in prison</a> on felony drug trafficking charges, smacked the phone out of the questioner's hand.  </p><p>"Sir, you cannot take my phone out of my hand," the questioner could be heard saying, before the phone was picked back up and returned to focus. Harris spent 10 years in prison on a drug trafficking charge before marrying Pressley, who said she draws from his experience of reintegrating into regular society after leaving prison to help inform how she advocates for incarcerated, or previously incarcerated, individuals.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/comer-vows-minnesota-fraud-probe-expand-other-states-amid-mounting-scrutiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COMER VOWS MINNESOTA FRAUD PROBE WILL EXPAND TO OTHER STATES AMID MOUNTING SCRUTINY</strong></a></p><p>The incident took place Monday at Chelsea City Hall located in Chelsea, Massachusetts.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the cameraman tried to focus the picture on Harris after his phone was knocked out of his hand, but Harris was seen walking into what appeared to be a bathroom, or some type of room off the hallway they were located in, once he was able to re-focus the camera.</p><p>Instead, the interviewer went back to Pressley and attempted a second time to get his question in. </p><p>"Congresswoman Pressley, do you support President Trump investigating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/country-star-mocks-minnesota-daycare-fraud-viral-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somali childcare fraud</a> in Minnesota?" he asked as the Massachusetts Democrat walked away, guarded by her entourage of staffers.

"My guess for how much fraud is happening nationwide is roughly 10% of the Federal budget, so about $700 billion per year."</p>
