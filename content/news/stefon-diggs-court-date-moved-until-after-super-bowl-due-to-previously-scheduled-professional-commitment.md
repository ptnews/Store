She tried to push him away, and then he "tried to choke her using the crook of his elbow around her neck."</p><p>"She said that he was behind her with his arm wrapped around her," wrote Officer Kenneth J. Ellis. "She said that she did feel like she had trouble breathing and that she felt like she could have blacked out."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/brock-purdy-says-49ers-have-chip-shoulder-entering-playoffs-after-missing-last-season"><strong>BROCK PURDY SAYS 49ERS HAVE A ‘CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER’ ENTERING PLAYOFFS AFTER MISSING LAST SEASON</strong></a></p><p>Diggs threw her on a bed and said "lies" when she told him she had not been paid, Ellis wrote. The chef sought payment for a week in November when Diggs was hosting house guests and had to go home, Ellis wrote. The woman "left her position" and the home in Dedham but returned Dec. 9 to retrieve her property. At that point, she told police, Diggs referred her to his assistant, who said she had to sign a nondisclosure agreement before she would be paid. She did not sign it, police said.</p><p>The woman was reluctant to file charges until later last month, Ellis wrote, when "she let me know that she had changed her mind from a few days ago" and wanted to pursue criminal charges.</p><p>In a statement, the team acknowledged the situation and said the 32-year-old receiver denied the allegations against him.</p><p>Diggs' teammate, Christian Barmore, is currently set for a court date on Feb. 3, five days before the Super Bowl in San Francisco, for allegedly assaulting a woman he was in a relationship with in August.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/second-patriot-star-disturbing-allegations-day-after-stefon-diggs-denies-strangulation-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Barmore allegedly grabbed</u></a> the the woman’s phone while she was trying to leave his residence. The alleged victim then "intended to open the door and scream for help, but Christian grabbed her before she could and threw her to the floor." Barmore then allegedly grabbed her by the shirt near her neck and allegedly told her he would have his cousin "f--- [her] up." Barmore was charged with one count of assault and battery on a family or household member.</p><p>David Meier is representing both players.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
