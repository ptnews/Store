<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry on Wednesday released nighttime video footage it claimed shows the wreckage of a Ukrainian drone intercepted during an attempted attack on a residence used by President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The video, filmed in a snow-covered, forested area in Russia, shows a Russian serviceman standing over debris that Moscow said belongs to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/drones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukrainian-made Chaklun-V drone</a>.</p><p>Russian officials also said the drone was shot down before it could strike <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin’s residence near Lake Valdai</a> in the Novgorod region and was carrying a six-kilogram explosive device that failed to detonate.</p><p>The footage was released as Moscow faced mounting skepticism over its account of events.</p><p><a

target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported Wednesday that U.S. national security officials concluded Ukraine did not target Putin or any of his residences in the alleged drone incident.</p><p>The Journal said the finding was supported by a CIA assessment that determined no attempted attack on Putin occurred, citing a U.S. official briefed on the intelligence.</p><p>Instead, Ukraine, they said, was believed to be targeting a military site it had previously struck in the same region but not near Putin’s residence, the official said.</p><p>Ukrainian officials have continued to reject the allegations, with a military drone expert claiming the video provided little evidence of an attempted strike on one of Russia’s most heavily secured locations.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-says-carried-out-first-ever-underwater-drone-strike-russian-submarine-novorossiysk" target="_blank"

anything other than that there is a wrecked drone on the ground somewhere being stood over by a Russian serviceman," <a href="https://draganfly.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Draganfly</a> CEO Cameron Chell told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Chell, whose firm supplies drones to the U.S. Department of Defense and its allies, said the drone shown in the video looked ill-suited for such a mission.</p><p>"The attacks that occurred on Dec. 29 were also hundreds of kilometers away," he added.</p><p>"The engines on the drone in this new footage are very small, and though capable of multiple hours of flight with the type of fixed-wing drone displayed, it would be extremely slow and unsophisticated.</p><p>"This drone is not untypical of many Ukraine drones, but these would only be used for infrastructure targets and woefully ineffective in an attack on a facility the likes of Putin’s residence," Chell concluded.</p><p><a

ON OTHER COUNTRIES 'IF YOU TREAT US WITH RESPECT'</strong></a></p><p>Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi also dismissed the footage as "laughable," saying Kyiv was "absolutely confident that no such attack took place," according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russia-releases-video-footage-challenge-kyiv-over-alleged-attack-2025-12-31/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>.</p><p>Russia alleges the drone was part of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broader Ukrainian operation</a> targeting Putin’s residence earlier this week.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted 91 drones had been intercepted en route to Putin’s residence, a figure that appeared to conflict with earlier Defense Ministry statements.</p><p>The ministry initially reported that 89 drones were shot down across eight regions, including 18 over Novgorod, before revising the numbers upward. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-alleges-attack-putin-residence-ukraine-denies-claim-ahead-trump-talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUSSIA ALLEGES ATTACK ON PUTIN RESIDENCE AS UKRAINE DENIES CLAIM AHEAD OF TRUMP TALKS</strong></a></p><p>Only after Lavrov’s remarks did the Defense Ministry claim that 49 drones intercepted over Bryansk — nearly 300 miles from Valdai — were also targeting the presidential residence.</p><p>The ministry initially reported that 89 drones were shot down across eight regions, including 18 over Novgorod, before revising the numbers upward. </p><p>The timing of the allegations has also drawn scrutiny, coming shortly after what Moscow described publicly as a positive meeting between President Trump and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> in Florida.</p><p>Zelenskyy also called the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/zelenskyy-denies-russian-claim-ukraine-attacked-putin-residence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged drone attack</a> a "complete fabrication," saying it was designed to justify further Russian strikes and undermine diplomatic efforts.</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected Ukraine’s denials and said Moscow would toughen its diplomatic stance.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment.</p>
