<p>New video footage shared Saturday shows the minutes that lead up to the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by a federal agent, according to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS).</p><p>DHS shared video on its X account that appeared to be three-and-a-half minutes of footage taken by a citizen from inside a nearby home showing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) agents and multiple vehicles out in the residential street.</p><p>A car can be heard honking its horn repeatedly while someone can be heard continually blowing a whistle. At one point, the video pans over to what appears to be Renee Nicole Good’s Honda Pilot that is parked in the middle of the street.</p><p>"The media continues to fail the American people in their reporting on the events in Minneapolis," DHS claimed in the post. "New evidence shows that the anti-ICE agitator was STALKING and IMPEDING a law enforcement operation over the course of the morning."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/left-wing-group-backs-tens-thousands-anti-ice-demonstrations-nationwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LEFT-WING GROUP BACKS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ANTI-ICE AGITATORS NATIONWIDE</strong></a></p><p>DHS further criticized the media, writing: "The evidence speaks for itself. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The legacy media</a> has lost the trust of the American people."</p><p><strong>WATCH: CELLPHONE VIDEO SHOWS DEADLY MINNEAPOLIS ICE SHOOTING: </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/tom-emmer-pushes-back-suggestion-minnesota-anti-ice-protesters-have-been-peaceful" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TOM EMMER PUSHES BACK ON SUGGESTION THAT MINNESOTA ANTI-ICE PROTESTERS HAVE BEEN PEACEFUL</strong></a></p><p>The video was released three days after an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minneapolis-ice-shooting-officer-followed-training-potentially-deadly-threat-drove-him-former-agent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE agent fatally shot Good</a> as she allegedly drove a vehicle toward officers.</p><p>The circumstances that led to her death have ignited a firestorm of criticism of the Trump administration and ICE.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/federal-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal officials</a> have defended the ICE agent’s actions as self-defense and described the Minneapolis shooting as an act of "domestic terrorism," while Democratic leaders have rejected that characterization and sharply condemned the officer’s conduct.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Louis Casiano contributed to this report.</i></p>
