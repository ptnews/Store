<p>John Harbaugh and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Giants</a> are working on an agreement to make him the team’s next head coach, per multiple reports. </p><p>The deal reportedly hasn’t been finalized, but <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jim-harbaugh-predicts-brothers-future-nfl-next-season-just-hope-its-nfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harbaugh is expected</a> to end up in New York, pending any unforeseen setbacks. </p><p>Harbaugh interviewed in person with the Giants on Wednesday, spending hours at the team facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Super Bowl-winning former coach of the Baltimore Ravens was believed to be New York’s top candidate in the search for Brian Daboll’s full-time successor.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ravens-fire-head-coach-john-harbaugh-18-seasons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fired by the Baltimore Ravens</a> after missing the playoffs on a missed field goal attempt at the buzzer in the season finale, Harbaugh is on track to pick the Giants over other possible landing spots, including Tennessee and Atlanta.</p><p>Harbaugh's release from the Ravens made him the most sought-after coaching candidate of the current cycle and, arguably, one of the most coveted coaching candidates in recent NFL history. </p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> even endorsed Harbaugh in a Truth Social Post, then in a later post specifically <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-urges-john-harbaugh-take-giants-head-coaching-job-following-stunning-ravens-firing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed the idea</a> of the Giants hiring Harbaugh. </p><p>"The New York Football Giants should hire, without question, John Harbaugh – And John, a great guy, should TAKE THE JOB!!!"

Interviewing Raheem Morris and Antonio Pierce satisfied the NFL’s Rooney Rule requirements for minority or female candidates, and Harbaugh’s visit to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">northern New Jersey</a> paved the way to make a hire before any of the more than half-dozen teams with a vacancy.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
