<p>One woman’s uncomfortable <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaction to alcohol</a> led to a grave discovery.</p><p>Hollie Thursby, 28, a mother of two from the U.K., told Kennedy News and Media that after giving birth to her second son, Jack, she began experiencing unusual symptoms.</p><p>At a checkup for her son, who was a couple of months old, Thursby mentioned that she was experiencing "unbearably itchy skin," which is known to be a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/reproductive-health/pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-partum symptom</a>. The doctor suggested it was due to changing hormones.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/deadly-cancer-risk-spikes-certain-level-alcohol-consumption-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEADLY CANCER RISK SPIKES WITH CERTAIN LEVEL OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, STUDY FINDS</strong></a></p><p>Thursby added that she occasionally drank a couple glasses of wine. Although she kept the drinking to a minimum, she described having "a lot of pain" down the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/lymphoma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">side of her neck</a>.</p><p>"Really quite painful and uncomfortable," she said, according to the report.</p><p>The mother also reported feeling extremely exhausted, which she assumed was due to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caring for her children</a> throughout the day.</p><p>"I also felt like when I got to bed that someone was sitting on my chest," she shared.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>In July 2025, Thursby discovered a lump on the side of her neck that she described as "really quite big," but wasn’t painful, Kennedy News and Media reported.</p><p>"It was hard, it didn’t move, but it was there," she said. "When I turned my neck to the side, you could see it."</p><p>Thursby’s symptoms turned out to be a form of blood cancer — Stage 2 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/blood-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hodgkins lymphoma</a>, which means it is in two or more lymph nodes, according to Cancer Research U.K.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</strong></a></p><p>Common symptoms include swelling of the lymph nodes, heavy sweating, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight loss</a>, itching, persistent cough or shortness of breath, high temperatures, and pain in the stomach or lymph nodes after drinking alcohol.</p><p>"Pain when you drink alcohol is actually a known side effect of Hodgkin lymphoma," she said, per the report. "It's something about the acidity in the wine and not when you drink other alcohol."</p><p>While alcohol-related pain in Hodgkins lymphoma patients has been "an accepted scientific consensus" since the 1950s, cases are rare, Healthline confirmed.</p><p>Thursby reportedly began chemotherapy in November, noting that the hardest part is not being able to care for her kids after losing her own mother to a blood disorder called myelodysplasia.</p><p>"I grew up without a mum, and it was horrendous. I can't do that to the boys," she told Kennedy News and Media. "We're all devastated, but we all know now, and we've got a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment plan</a>, which is what we need."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>"I'm just doing everything I can to get better for them. I keep telling myself this is only temporary, I just need to keep going."</p><p>Anyone experiencing pain or other concerning symptoms after consuming alcohol should <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consult a doctor</a> for guidance.</p>
