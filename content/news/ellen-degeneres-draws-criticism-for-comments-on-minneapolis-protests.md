<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ellen-degeneres" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen DeGeneres</a> weighed in on the unrest roiling Minneapolis as she remembered the Midwestern city as the "happiest in America."</p><p>Daily protests have been ongoing throughout January since the Department of Homeland Security ramped up immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul by bringing in more than 2,000 federal officers. The operation has become more confrontational since the fatal shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7.</p><p>"I just wanted to say I am so sorry for what is happening in Minneapolis and our country, really, but specifically Minneapolis right now," DeGeneres began <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTquV4Ekoa1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in her video</a>. "Because it's where I shot my last stand-up special, and everybody there couldn't have been more lovely."</p><p>"I shot it there because they say it's the happiest city in America. And I found that to be true," the comedian added. "So my thoughts and my prayers are going out to everyone. And I'm proud of everyone who's protesting peacefully, and I am sorry for anyone who has been hurt just for protesting, for doing what you should be doing."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ellen-degeneres-shows-off-country-life-uk-after-fleeing-us-following-trumps-2024-presidential-win" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ELLEN DEGENERES SHOWS OFF COUNTRY LIFE IN UK AFTER FLEEING US FOLLOWING TRUMP'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL WIN</strong></a></p><p>Her post drew mixed reactions, as some shared support while others criticized DeGeneres' choice to share the video.</p><p>"Love will always outweigh hate!" a user said.</p><p>"Wow, I agree with you on this even though we differ politically! Peace through unity," another added.</p><p>"As a Minnesotan, thank you. It’s rough here," someone else said.</p><p>"Ellen has no clue what’s going on out there," one user wrote.</p><p>"Ellen you should ask these illegal immigrants to cooperate with ICE so no one has to protest," another commented.</p><p>"I am so sorry too ! Why don’t these people stay home and let ICE do the job we as a country voted for," another user wrote.</p><p>"You really think anyone cares what you think now? Dream on," another user added, seemingly referencing DeGeneres' decision to leave the U.S. after Trump's re-election in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
