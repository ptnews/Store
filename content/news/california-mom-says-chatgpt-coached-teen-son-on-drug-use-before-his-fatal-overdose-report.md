<p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California teenager</a> used a chatbot over several months for drug-use guidance on ChatGPT, his mother said. </p><p>Sam Nelson, 18, was preparing for college when he asked an AI chatbot how many grams of kratom, a plant-based painkiller commonly sold at smoke shops and gas stations across the country, he would need to get a strong high, his mother, Leila Turner-Scott, told SFGate, according to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/06/us-news/california-teen-dies-of-overdose-after-months-seeking-drug-advice-from-chatgpt-mother-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Post</a>. </p><p>The chatbot told Nelson that it could not provide guidance on substance use and directed Nelson to seek help from a health care professional.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/faith-deficit-artificial-intelligence-should-alarm-every-american" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>THE FAITH DEFICIT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD ALARM EVERY AMERICAN</u></strong></a></p><p>"Hopefully I don’t overdose then," the teen responded before ending the chat. </p><p>Over several months, he regularly used <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI’s ChatGPT</a> for help with his schoolwork, as well as questions about drugs.</p><p>Nelson's mother, Leila Turner-Scott, said ChatGPT began coaching her son on how to take drugs and to manage the effects. </p><p>"Hell yes — let’s go full trippy mode," he wrote in one exchange before the chatbot allegedly told the teen to double the amount of cough syrup to heighten hallucinations.</p><p>The chatbot repeatedly offered Nelson doting messages and constant encouragement, Turner-Scott claimed.</p><p>During a February 2023 exchange obtained by SF Gate, Nelson talked about smoking cannabis while taking a high dose of Xanax.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmakers-unveil-bipartisan-guard-act-parents-blame-ai-chatbots-teen-suicides-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LAWMAKERS UNVEIL BIPARTISAN GUARD ACT AFTER PARENTS BLAME AI CHATBOTS FOR TEEN SUICIDES, VIOLENCE</u></strong></a></p><p>"I can’t smoke weed normally due to anxiety," he explained, asking if it was safe to combine the two substances.</p><p>When ChatGPT cautioned that the drug combination was unsafe, so Nelson rephrased his wording from "high dose" to "moderate amount."</p><p>Months later, Nelson told his mother in May 2025 that the chatbot exchanges had resulted in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drug and alcohol</a> addiction. She took him to a clinic where professionals detailed a treatment plan. </p><p>However, Nelson died the next day from an overdose in his San Jose bedroom. </p><p>"I knew he was using it," Turner-Scott told <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/calif-teen-chatgpt-drug-advice-fatal-overdose-21266718.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SFGate</a>. "But I had no idea it was even possible to go to this level.</p><p>OpenAI said ChatGPT is prohibited from offering detailed guidance on illicit drug use.</p><p>An OpenAI spokesperson described the teen’s overdose as "heartbreaking" and extended the company’s condolences to his family.</p><p>"When people come to ChatGPT with sensitive questions, our models are designed to respond with care — providing factual information, refusing or safely handling requests for harmful content, and encouraging users to seek real-world support," an OpenAI spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15435755/California-man-19-died-overdose-making-ChatGPT-AI-drug-buddy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>"We continue to strengthen how our models recognize and respond to signs of distress, guided by ongoing work with clinicians and health experts."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to OpenAI for comment. </p>
