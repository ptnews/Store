McKee was Monique's ex-husband.</p><p>McKee faces upgraded charges of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">premeditated aggravated murder</a> in Ohio in relation to the Tepes' deaths.</p><p>Divorce records obtained by Fox News Digital show the couple got married on Aug. 22, 2015, and were separated by March 2016.

"It was an address that doesn't exist."</p><p>The address provided by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas Surgical Associates</a> was also non-existent, and the phone number associated with his state medical board profile led Laird to a fax machine.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/surgeon-ex-ohio-dentist-murders-job-hopped-across-country-dodged-lawsuits-after-divorce" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SURGEON EX IN OHIO DENTIST MURDERS JOB HOPPED ACROSS COUNTRY, DODGED LAWSUITS AFTER DIVORCE</strong></a></p><p>Laird said he attempted to reach McKee through former co-workers, which included another individual named in the lawsuit, Dr. Peter Caravella.</p><p>"He said he has no idea where Dr. Michael McKee is now," Laird said, recalling his conversation with Caravella. "He just disappeared."</p><p>Laird said the process server he used <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted to locate and serve McKee</a> nine times, all of which failed.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada judge</a> in October granted a declaration of due diligence, which allowed McKee to be served through a newspaper notice.</p><p>Forensic scientist and Jacksonville State University Professor Joseph Scott Morgan told Fox News Digital McKee may have been trying to "disguise" himself.</p><p>"Well, for me, from an investigative standpoint, it would seem to imply that there was maybe intent to disguise themselves," Morgan said.</p><p>Morgan added that this level of deception would make sense for someone trying to throw people off, like investigators or a potential lawsuit.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-dentist-double-murder-fmr-police-chief-reveals-multitude-reasons-ex-husband-allegedly-killed-couple" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OHIO DENTIST DOUBLE MURDER: FMR POLICE CHIEF REVEALS ‘MULTITUDE’ OF REASONS EX-HUSBAND ALLEGEDLY KILLED COUPLE</strong></a></p><p>"Why are you going to deceive them to this level? Unless you're trying to put people off of a scent. Because look, I mean, with a physical address, you have to think about if there's going to be a warrant served. If there's going to be any kind of papers that are served from a court, they're literally going to go to a physical address and track you down," Morgan said.</p><p>"Had he developed some level, some kind of paranoid delusion or something where he's trying to create and trying to stay ahead?" he asked.</p><p>McKee is awaiting extradition from the Winnebago County jail in Rockford, Illinois, where he's being held. Once McKee is extradited, he'll be taken to Columbus, Ohio.</p>
