<p>New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/zohran-mamdani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a> on Saturday said he was briefed on plans to imprison Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife in New York City, calling their capture an "act of war and a violation of federal and international law."</p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> announced the couple's capture in a "large scale strike" Saturday morning, following months of assaults on suspected drug vessels allegedly tied to the Venezuelan regime in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.</p><p>The Venezuelan government said in a statement the attack was carried out to seize the country's oil and minerals, and was an "attempt to impose a colonial war to destroy the republican form of government and force a ‘<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regime change</a>,’ in alliance with the fascist oligarchy."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/from-bus-driver-dictator-nicolas-maduros-rise-fall-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FROM BUS DRIVER TO DICTATOR: NICOLÁS MADURO’S RISE AND FALL IN VENEZUELA</strong></a></p><p>Mamdani, a Democratic socialist inaugurated on New Year's Day, said during a news conference Saturday he discussed the matter with Trump on the phone, pushing back on the commander-in-chief's decision.</p><p>"I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act, and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law, and a desire to see that be consistent each and every day," Mamdani said. "I registered my opposition, I made it clear, and we left it at that."</p><p>The mayor later took to X, claiming the "blatant pursuit of regime change" will directly impact New Yorkers and Venezuelans living in New York City.</p><p>"My focus is their safety and the safety of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every New Yorker</a>, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance," Mamdani wrote in the post.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/us-strikes-venezuela-maduro-captured-january-3-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIVE UPDATES: TRUMP CONFIRMS OVERNIGHT STRIKES IN VENEZUELA, SAYS US HAS ‘CAPTURED’ MADURO</u></strong></a></p><p>Both Maduro and Mamdani believe in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/socialism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redistributing wealth</a> downward, with Mamdani focused on taxing the wealthy and corporations to fund public services, and Maduro redistributing wealth through oil revenues and state control of resources.</p><p>Mamdani also campaigned on public-run housing, childcare, transit and city-owned grocery stores, similar to Maduro's policies of state-run food distribution, healthcare and housing.</p><p>However, Venezuelan socialism involves nationalization and central control, which led to an economic collapse and authoritarian drift.</p><p>Mamdani's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p>
