We won't allow it in America," she said, as the agency appeared to defend its use-of-force tactics, citing the Portland facility being "under siege" for some time.</p><p>"Rioters have attacked law enforcement officials, destroyed federal property, and have posted death threats at the facility. Outside of the facility, graffiti on the sidewalk reads ‘Kill Your Masters’," the agency said in a July statement.</p><p>"Across the country, federal law enforcement has come under attack. Gunmen opened fire on Border Patrol and ICE officers in Texas over the Fourth of July weekend on two separate occasions, seriously wounding two," the statement added.</p>
