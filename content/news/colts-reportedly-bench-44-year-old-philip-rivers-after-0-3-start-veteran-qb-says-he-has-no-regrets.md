<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/indianapolis-colts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indianapolis Colts</a> are reportedly making a change at quarterback, benching the 44-year-old Philip Rivers after three games for rookie Riley Leonard. </p><p>Rivers, who recently became a grandfather, improbably came back after retiring in 2020 to try and spark a playoff run. The team went 0-3 in his starts, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/philip-rivers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but Rivers</a> played admirably and said he has no regrets about coming back. </p><p>"I mean if this was the last one, shoot, I told you guys I wasn’t going to have any regrets about coming back, and I don’t. It’s other than us not winning, right? It’s been an absolute blast for three weeks. I wouldn’t, if I go back and say, ‘All right, now you know everything that’s going to happen. What are you going to do?’ I’d do it all again. It’s been absolutely awesome. I mean, if it’s the last one, it’s the last one," Rivers said during his press conference after the Colts' loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Rivers said he will be back on the sideline coaching next year and that he will not be making another return to the field. The eight-time Pro Bowler said he is thankful for getting three bonus games.</p><p>"I thought the last (game) was walking off the field in Buffalo, walking up that tunnel, and I was fine with that. And that one had tears and those few days after I was at peace with that being the last one. So certainly if it is, I got three bonus games I never saw coming and couldn’t be more thankful that I got the opportunity," Rivers said. </p><p>"It’s been a blast to be out there and prepare with these guys and fight with them. Just hate that we haven’t been able to get it done."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/why-philip-rivers-nfl-comeback-story-resonating-christians" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHY PHILIP RIVERS' NFL COMEBACK STORY IS RESONATING WITH CHRISTIANS</strong></a></p><p>Rivers thought he played the worst of his three games in the team's loss to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Jaguars,</a> saying he couldn’t get in sync or get any rhythm. Against the Jaguars, Rivers completed 17 of 30 passes for 147 yards with one touchdown and one interception. </p><p>While the Colts didn’t win any of Rivers’ starts, they were in all three games. His best performance came against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco 49ers</a> last week, when he completed 23 of 35 passes for 277 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in a 48-27 loss. </p><p>Daniel Jones tore his Achilles tendon in a loss to the Jaguars at the beginning of the month, and Leonard came in relief. However, Leonard got injured during that game, which opened the door for Rivers to return.</p><p>Now, with the team out of a playoff spot and Leonard back to full health, he will start in the team’s Week 18 matchup against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/houston-texans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houston Texans</a>. The Colts and Texans play at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday. </p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
