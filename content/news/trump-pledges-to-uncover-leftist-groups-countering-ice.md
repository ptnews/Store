<p>President Donald Trump said that he believes the woman fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minneapolis</a> last week may have been a professional agitator, and indicated that the government will uncover the funding sources behind such anti-law enforcement agitation.</p><p>"The woman and her friend were highly disrespectful of law enforcement," Trump said during a Sunday gaggle aboard Air Force One. "They were harassing," he said, noting, "I think frankly, they're professional agitators."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president</a> added that he would "like to find out, and we are gonna find out, who's paying for it, with their brand-new signs, and all the different things."</p><p>"But these are professional agitators. And law enforcement should not be in a position where they have to put up with this stuff. What that woman, and what her friend, and what their other friends were doing to law enforcement — not just ICE — law enforcement, is outrageous," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-defends-ice-agent-shows-nyt-reporters-video-deadly-minneapolis-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP DEFENDS ICE AGENT, SHOWS NYT REPORTERS VIDEO OF DEADLY MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING</strong></a></p><p>The U.S. Department of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeland Security</a> retweeted a post in which Republican Rep.
