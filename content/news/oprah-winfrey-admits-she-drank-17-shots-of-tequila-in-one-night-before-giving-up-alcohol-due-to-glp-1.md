<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/oprah-winfrey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oprah Winfrey</a> is opening up about her weight-loss journey.</p><p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://people.com/oprah-opens-up-about-obesity-glp-1s-and-her-new-life-exclusive-11877105" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">People magazine</a>, the 71-year-old television personality discussed her new book, "Enough," which she co-wrote with obesity expert Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff, which details her journey with obesity, saying, "I feel more alive and more vibrant than I’ve ever been."</p><p>"I feel like I have more to give to everybody. I’m just more open to all," she said. "I was a big fan of tequila. I literally had 17 shots one night... I haven’t had a drink in years. The fact that I no longer even have a desire for it is pretty amazing."</p><p>The former talk show host began taking GLP-1 weight loss medication over two years ago, when she realized her lifelong struggle with her weight was due to obesity, a word she "avoided" before.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/obesity-expert-reveals-best-way-decide-glp-1s-right-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OBESITY EXPERT REVEALS THE BEST WAY TO DECIDE IF GLP-1S ARE RIGHT FOR YOU</strong></a></p><p>Her epiphany came in 2023 when she hosted a special featuring experts on obesity, saying filming the special helped her realize that "overeating doesn’t cause obesity. Obesity causes overeating," calling that moment "the most mind-blowing, freeing thing I’ve experienced as an adult."</p><p>"If you have obesity in your gene pool, I want people to know it’s not your fault," Winfrey said. "I want people to stop blaming yourself for genes and an environment you can’t control. I want people to have the information, whatever you choose to do with it, whether you get the medications, or whether you want to keep dieting."</p><p>After starting the GLP-1 medication, Winfrey feels like "everything is just calmer and stronger" by helping her "manage the messages that are being sent to your brain about overeating."</p><p>Without the constant messaging about food, the "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/wrinkle-in-time-movie-is-more-appropriate-now-than-ever-oprah-winfrey-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Wrinkle in Time</a>" star said she has been given "a quiet strength that comes with everything I do."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Winfrey discussed her struggles with losing weight and the media's obsession with her size during a March 2024 ABC special, called "An Oprah Special: Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution."</p><p>During the special, she admitted she once starved herself on a liquid diet "in an effort to combat the shame" for nearly five months in 1988 "and then wheeled out that wagon of fat [on her show] that the internet will never let me forget and after losing 67 pounds on a liquid diet, next day, y’all, the very next day, I started to gain it back." </p><p>She later added that it's "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jessica-simpson-retreats-nashville-after-public-fat-shaming-sparked-decade-ptsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrong to be shaming people</a>" with obesity if you don't struggle with it, because it's hard to truly understand what the person is dealing with.</p><p>"All these years, I thought all of the people who never had to diet were just using their willpower and they were for some reason stronger than me, and now I realize y'all weren't even thinking about the food. It's not that you had the willpower. You weren't thinking about it. You weren't obsessing about it. That is the big thing I learned."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
