<p>Despite widespread protests and intense pressure from local and state politicians to cease operations, the Department of Homeland Security said that its agents are continuing to remove the "scourge" of sexual predators, violent assailants, domestic abusers and drug traffickers from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minneapolis streets</a>.</p><p>Immigration enforcement agents in the city have faced intense opposition from anti-ICE agitators, especially since the fatal shooting of activist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/renee-nicole-good-part-ice-watch-group-dhs-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renee Nicole Good</a>. Despite this, DHS said its efforts in Minneapolis, dubbed "Operation Metro Surge," have continued to nab illegal immigrants with serious criminal records.</p><p>Among those arrested by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DHS agents</a> this week is Teng Houa Vang, an illegal alien from Thailand, who, according to the agency, has been convicted of domestic assault and pled guilty to terroristic threats and violation of a protection order. He has also been charged with arson, peeping tom, obstructing police, trespassing, assault, drug possession, and property damage.</p><p>Another, Michael Opeoluwa Egbele, from Nigeria, was arrested by immigration officials on Tuesday and has been convicted of fraud and impersonation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minneapolis-mayor-defends-sanctuary-stance-illegal-immigrant-allegedly-kills-woman-drunk-driving"><strong>MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR DEFENDS SANCTUARY STANCE AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ALLEGEDLY KILLS WOMAN WHILE DRUNK DRIVING</strong></a></p><p>A third, Francisco Salazar-Solorzano, from El Salvador, was also arrested on Tuesday and has been charged with assault, domestic violence, and driving under the influence of liquor.</p><p>Mexican illegal immigrant Victor Javier Bahena-Sandoval was also arrested in Minneapolis and has a criminal history that includes an arrest for domestic violence and convictions for four counts of disorderly conduct and illegal re-entry.

"Another day, another scourge of sexual predators, violent assailants, domestic abusers, and drug traffickers arrested from the streets of Minnesota by our law enforcement."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/renee-goods-former-father-in-law-says-i-dont-blame-ice-deadly-shooting"><strong>RENEE GOOD'S FORMER FATHER-IN-LAW SAYS 'I DON'T BLAME ICE' FOR DEADLY SHOOTING</strong></a></p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the offices of Walz and Frey but did not immediately receive a response. </p>
