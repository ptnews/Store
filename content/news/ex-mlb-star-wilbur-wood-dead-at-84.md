<p>Wilbur Wood, a three-time All-Star pitcher who made opposing batters swing and miss with a nasty knuckleball, has died, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/chicago-white-sox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago White Sox</a> announced. He was 84.</p><p>Wood spent 17 seasons in the majors from 1961 to 1978, spending 12 seasons with the White Sox.

But he made his biggest impact with the White Sox.</p><p>He started as a reliever for the White Sox.

He won at least 20 games from 1971 through 1974.</p><p>He suffered a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/injuries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fractured kneecap</a> on a line drive early in the 1976 season.
