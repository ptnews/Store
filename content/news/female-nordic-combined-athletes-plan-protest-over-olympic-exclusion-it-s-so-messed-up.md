It will be one of the few events that will not have female participants.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>American athlete Annika Malacinski <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/nordic-combined-women-set-stage-protest-against-olympic-exclusion-2026-01-27/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told Reuters</a> that she and her competitors will hold up an "X" with their poles before they begin a race in Seefeld, Austria, to symbolize "no exception."</p><p>"It's so messed up that the women are excluded, because we checked off everything that the IOC wanted to see, but at the end of the day, what hurts is that the IOC doesn't see the quality of adding women. We can't go another cycle without full equality in the Olympics," she told the outlet.</p><p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) told Reuters it recognized the issues the sport faces in terms of popularity for both men and women, including general popularity and the lack of competitiveness.</p><p>"The IOC will continue to support the International Ski Federation (FIS) in the development and promotion of Nordic Combined," the IOC said.

"It feels like we’re being told that our dreams matter less. It also fuels me, because it shows how important it is that we keep speaking up."</p><p>The athletes will have to wait until the 2030 Olympics to see whether a women’s Nordic combined event will be added to the schedule.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
