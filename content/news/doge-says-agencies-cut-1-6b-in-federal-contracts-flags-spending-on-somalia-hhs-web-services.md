<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) said Friday that federal agencies have terminated or reduced 55 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doge-ends-108-wasteful-contracts-including-executive-transformational-leadership-training-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contracts</a> over the last three days with a combined ceiling value of $1.6 billion, claiming $542 million in savings.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doge-staffing-shakeup-elon-musk-hangs-up-his-hat-white-house-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOGE</a>, whose name nods to Elon Musk’s high-profile involvement, was launched during the opening days of President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>’s second administration as part of a broader effort to reshape federal spending and bureaucracy.</p><p>While Musk has since stepped back from the project, elements of the DOGE framework <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-main-doge-office-shutters-its-war-government-waste-isnt-over" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remain</a> active across federal agencies.</p><p>In a post on X, the department wrote: "Contracts Update! Over the last 3 days, agencies terminated and descoped 55 wasteful contracts with a ceiling value of $1.6B and savings of $542M."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-sending-9-4-billion-doge-cuts-package-congress-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHITE HOUSE SENDING $9.4 BILLION DOGE CUTS PACKAGE TO CONGRESS NEXT WEEK</strong></a></p><p>The post listed several examples, including what it described as "a $47M <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Dept.</a> program support contract for ‘Africa / Djibouti, Somalia armored personnel carriers and Somalia National Army crew’," and "a $19.5M HHS IT Services contract for support for National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in designing, creating, updating, maintaining, and archiving online communications."</p><p>DOGE also referenced "a $151k DoW <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education</a> services contract for ‘Director’s Development Program in Leadership - Partnership course to be held at Northwestern University’," according to the post.</p><p>Screenshots shared with the DOGE post show federal contract records matching the descriptions and dollar amounts cited.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doge-go-on-hill-pork-hawk-says-rooting-out-government-waste-continue-after-elon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOGE WILL GO ON: HILL PORK HAWK SAYS ROOTING OUT GOVERNMENT WASTE WILL CONTINUE AFTER ELON</strong></a></p><p>One screenshot shows a contract record tied to Somalia, listing professional program management support under a federal services code and identifying the country of service origin as Somalia.
