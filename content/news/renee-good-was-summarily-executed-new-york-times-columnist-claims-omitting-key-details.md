<p>A New York Times opinion piece omitted several details while describing the fatal shooting of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/renee-good-shot-four-times-including-head-fire-report-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota woman Renee Good</a> by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer after claiming Good was "summarily executed."</p><p>"We have become a country where a person can be summarily executed in public for protesting that paramilitary force," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/18/opinion/trump-one-year-later.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a> columnist M. Gessen wrote on Sunday. </p><p>Gessen continued, "After an ICE agent killed Renee Good by shooting her three times at point-blank range in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other federal officials said the shooting was justified as an act of self-defense (the video shows otherwise) and pointed to Good’s ostensible affiliation with left-wing groups — apparently affirming that protest is now punishable by death in America."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/renee-goods-former-father-in-law-says-deadly-shooting-result-bad-choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RENEE GOOD’S FORMER FATHER-IN-LAW SAYS DEADLY SHOOTING WAS RESULT OF 'BAD CHOICES'</strong></a></p><p>Gessen also referred to Good's death on Jan. 7 as an "execution" later in the article while lamenting limits to pushing back against the Trump administration.</p><p>"And the execution of Renee Good has surely affected every potential protester’s mental calculus," Gessen wrote.</p><p>Gessen's article, however, did not include any additional context on the shooting, such as Good driving a Honda Pilot SUV in the direction of ICE officers after allegedly ignoring demands to step out of the vehicle.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also reported that the ICE officer who shot Good <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-agent-struck-renee-goods-vehicle-suffered-internal-bleeding-torso-dhs-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered internal bleeding</a> to his torso when he was struck by her vehicle, though the extent of the bleeding was not made immediately clear.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minnesotas-major-newspaper-demands-ice-end-occupation-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA'S MAJOR NEWSPAPER DEMANDS ICE END 'OCCUPATION' OF STATE</strong></a></p><p>These details were not available in Gessen's article.</p><p>Gessen instead praised Minnesota residents for "speaking, writing, publishing, protesting, voting" against the administration's ICE operations, claiming that they are hunting people.</p><p>"We have become a country where people are disappeared by a paramilitary force that hunts them down in their apartments, on city streets and country roads, and even in the courts. Less than a year ago, videos of ICE arrests would go viral and social media posts about ICE sightings would send chills down our spines. Now even the most high-profile detentions have faded from view: Who has been released? Who has been deported? Who is still missing?"
