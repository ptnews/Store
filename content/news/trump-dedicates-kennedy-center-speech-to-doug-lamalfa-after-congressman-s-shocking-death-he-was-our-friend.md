The president praised LaMalfa for always standing by him in votes, and said it was to his credit that Trump never had to call him to rally his support.</p><p>"I spoke to Doug, but I didn't speak to him, you know? I mean, we never had a problem. I was really saddened by his passing and was thinking about not even doing the speech in his honor," Trump said. "But then I decided that I have to do it in his honor. I'll do it in his honor because he would've wanted it that way."</p><p>"He would've said, 'Do that speech! Are you kidding me? Do the speech,'" he continued. "He was a fantastic person. Man, that was a quick one. I don't know quite yet what happened, but boy is that a tough one. He was just with us. He was our friend. All of us, every one of us."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nrsc-chair-reveals-how-many-gop-senate-seats-gunning-for-2026-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SENATE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CHAIR REVEALS HOW MANY SEATS HE'S AIMING FOR IN 2026</u></strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-rep-doug-lamalfa-dead-65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaMalfa, 65, died</a> Tuesday morning, but the circumstances of his passing have yet to be confirmed.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Majority Whip</a> Tom Emmer, R-Minn., confirmed LaMalfa's death on X.</p><p>"Jacquie and I are devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.
