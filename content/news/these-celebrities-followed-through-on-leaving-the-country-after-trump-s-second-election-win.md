<p>More than a year after President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> began his second term, some celebrities have followed through on the often-touted promises to move out of the United States.</p><p>In an interview with The Times on Friday, "Twilight" actress Kristen Stewart spoke about her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kristen-stewart-plans-dramatic-exit-from-us-over-trumps-america-first-film-industry-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to eventually move</a> out of the country because of Trump's threat of tariffs on movies made outside the United States.</p><p>"Reality is breaking completely under Trump," she said. "But we should take a page out of his book and create the reality we want to live in."</p><p>Though she has yet to leave the country, Stewart made clear that she was "probably not" going to remain in the states after claiming she "can't work freely" in America.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/trump-victory-hollywood-elite-who-vowed-leave-us-he-won-all-talk-no-walk-expert-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP'S VICTORY: HOLLYWOOD ELITE WHO VOWED TO LEAVE US IF HE WON ARE 'ALL TALK, NO WALK,' EXPERT SAYS</strong></a></p><p>Stewart's comments came less than a week after "Avatar" and "Titanic" director James Cameron spoke about his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/james-cameron-slams-us-going-the-wrong-direction-reveals-why-he-traded-america-sane-new-zealand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decision to move from</a> the U.S. to New Zealand. Although Cameron had lived in New Zealand prior to the 2024 presidential election, he became a legal New Zealand citizen in 2025 and cited politics as a factor.</p><p>"I’m not there for scenery. I’m there for the sanity," Cameron said.</p><p>He pointed to New Zealand's handling of the coronavirus pandemic compared to the U.S. under Trump in 2020, suggesting that New Zealand was more "sane."</p><p>"Are you kidding me? Where would you rather live?" Cameron said. "A place that actually believes in science and is sane and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody’s at each other’s throats, extremely polarized, turning its back on science and basically would be in utter disarray if another pandemic appears."</p><p>Former daytime talk show host and comedian Ellen DeGeneres directly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ellen-degeneres-blames-trump-her-us-exodus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed to Trump's re-election</a> as the reason she and her wife, Portia de Rossi, have remained in the United Kingdom since moving in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/star-wars-actor-mark-hamill-reveals-he-considered-leaving-us-when-trump-won-reelection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>‘STAR WARS’ ACTOR MARK HAMILL REVEALS HE CONSIDERED LEAVING THE US WHEN TRUMP WON REELECTION</strong></a></p><p>"We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, 'He got in,'" she told broadcaster Richard Bacon, according to the BBC in July. "And we're like, 'We're staying here.'"</p><p>The most notable example of an anti-Trump celebrity who moved after his election was comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who confirmed in March that she had moved to Ireland and applied for citizenship <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rosie-odonnell-flees-us-after-trump-win-wont-return-until-safe-all-citizens-have-equal-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after Trump's re-election</a>.</p><p>"Although I was someone who never thought I would move to another country, that’s what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child," she said on TikTok.</p><p>Some celebrities have moved out of the country following Trump's election, though they have not directly cited Trump or his policies as a reason.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/hollywood-insiders-say-trumps-return-has-chilling-effect-film-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOLLYWOOD INSIDERS SAY TRUMP'S RETURN HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON FILM INDUSTRY</strong></a></p><p>In August, "House of Cards" and "The Princess Bride" actress Robin Wright <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/house-cards-actress-joins-hollywood-exodus-from-us-after-calling-country-s-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described leaving the U.S.</a> as "liberating," saying that in America, "everything’s rush, competition and speed."</p><p>"America is a s---show," she added.</p><p>Actors Richard Gere and Eva Longoria are also anti-Trump critics who have moved out of the country, but both have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/eva-longoria-says-trumps-win-not-why-she-left-us-despite-sharing-anxieties-over-his-victory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited other reasons</a>.</p><p>Other celebrities such as Barbra Streisand, Cher and Sharon Stone have vowed to leave the U.S. after Trump's re-election but have yet to do so.</p>
