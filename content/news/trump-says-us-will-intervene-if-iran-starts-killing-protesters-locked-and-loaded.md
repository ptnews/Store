<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> warned early Friday that the U.S. would intervene if Iran started killing protesters. </p><p>Writing on Truth Social, the president said if Iran shoots and "violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue." </p><p>"We are locked and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loaded and ready to go</a>," Trump said. </p><p>Trump’s warning comes as demonstrations triggered by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran’s deteriorating economy</a> expand beyond the capital and raise concerns about a potential heavy-handed crackdown by security forces. At least seven people — including protesters and members of Iran’s security services — have been <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-protests-turn-deadly-anti-regime-demonstrations-enter-fifth-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported killed during clashes</a>, according to international reporting.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-protesters-clash-security-forces-tear-gas-fills-tehran-streets-amid-nationwide-unrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRANIAN PROTESTERS CLASH WITH SECURITY FORCES AS TEAR GAS FILLS TEHRAN STREETS AMID NATIONWIDE UNREST</strong></a></p><p>Some of the most severe violence has been reported in western Iran, where videos circulating online appeared to show fires burning in streets and the sound of gunfire during nighttime protests. </p><p>The unrest marks Iran’s most <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significant protests</a> since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody sparked nationwide demonstrations. Officials say the current protests have not yet reached the same scale or intensity, but they have spread to multiple regions and include chants directed at Iran’s theocratic leadership.</p><p>Iran’s civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has signaled a willingness to engage with protesters, but the administration faces limited options as the country’s economy continues to deteriorate. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/us-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran’s currency</a> has sharply depreciated, with roughly 1.4 million rials now required to buy a single U.S. dollar, intensifying public anger and eroding confidence in the government.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hints-regime-change-iran-while-declaring-make-iran-great-again-after-us-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP HINTS AT REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN WHILE DECLARING 'MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN' AFTER US STRIKES</strong></a></p><p>State television reported the arrests of several people accused of exploiting the unrest, including individuals it described as monarchists and others allegedly linked to Europe-based groups. Authorities also claimed security forces seized smuggled weapons during related operations, though details remain limited.</p><p>The demonstrations come amid heightened regional tensions following a 12-day conflict with Israel in June, during which the United States bombed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/nuclear-proliferation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iranian nuclear sites</a>. Iranian officials have since said the country is no longer enriching uranium, attempting to signal openness to renewed negotiations over its nuclear program to ease sanctions.</p><p>However, talks have yet to resume, as both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> have warned Tehran against reconstituting its nuclear capabilities — adding further pressure on Iran’s leadership as protests continue.</p>
