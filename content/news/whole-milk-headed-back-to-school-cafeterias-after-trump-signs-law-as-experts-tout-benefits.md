<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> signed the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act into law Wednesday — a piece of legislation that brings whole milk and 2% milk back into schools.</p><p>Obama-era USDA school-meal rules — under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act — previously banned whole milk, requiring schools to only offer fat-free, low-fat, flavored or unflavored milk options.</p><p>"With this legislation, schools will finally be able to expand their offerings to include <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nutritious whole milk</a>," the president said during the signing. "This is the perfect follow-up to the new Real Food pyramid."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/food-pyramid-faces-scrutiny-ben-carson-reveals-why-americans-dont-have-eat-meat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOOD PYRAMID FACES SCRUTINY AS BEN CARSON REVEALS WHY AMERICANS DON'T HAVE TO EAT MEAT</strong></a></p><p>The bill also allows parents to request milk substitutes, while a written statement from a doctor was previously required. </p><p>"We're eliminating that rather ridiculous policy, allowing parents to choose what is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/childrens-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best for their child</a>, which is a big move," Trump added.</p><p>The change comes a week after the release of the flipped food pyramid, part of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/maha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Make America Healthy Again</a> movement’s proactive approach to health.</p><p>At the signing, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said President Trump has ended the war on saturated fat that's taken over school menus, "even though science [has] never shown that whole milk harms children."</p><p>"The panoply of nutrients in whole milk is critical to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain development</a> and physical development in our children," said Kennedy.</p><p>The secretary linked the increase in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/obesity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childhood obesity</a> and diabetes to the removal of whole milk from schools over the past 15 years.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>A 2020 study by University of Toronto professors, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found an association between higher cow’s-milk fat consumption and lower body-fat levels in children ages 1 to 18.</p><p>Dr. Neha Pathak, a chief physician editor for WebMD and a previous <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physician leader</a> in Atlanta, told Fox News Digital that different types of milk mainly vary by how much fat they contain.</p><p>"As you go down in milk fat percentage, you generally get fewer calories and less saturated fat, while protein and calcium stay broadly similar," Pathak said.</p><p>Certain vitamins, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vitamins-supplements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vitamin D</a>, are typically added back through fortification, she noted.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</strong></a></p><p>Addressing the rise of plant-based milks, Pathak said their protein content is often lower than cow’s milk. </p><p>The exception would be soy and pea milk, which can have protein at comparable levels to dairy, she added.</p><p>Dr. Ben Carson, USDA's national advisor for nutrition, health and housing, told Fox News Digital whole milk helps support brain development.</p><p>"Children’s brains are growing so rapidly, and milk provides the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy fats</a> that are essential for brain development," said Carson.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>"Whole milk is a high-quality protein that helps kids have strong bones and teeth with its vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus content."</p><p>Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel told Fox News Digital that while whole milk may not have less sugar than low-fat or no-fat milk, there are many other benefits.</p><p>"[Whole milk] offer[s] more protein, calcium, vitamin D and minerals that are good for you, and it promotes satiety, which may keep you from overeating," the doctor said.</p><p>"It may also decrease your risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome and keep you from other <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addictive substances</a>."</p>
