<p>Researchers recently identified Indonesian cave art dating back about 68,000 years — a breakthrough discovery that marks one of the earliest known expressions of human creativity.</p><p>The rock art was found in a cave on the island of Sulawesi, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tropical island</a> in central Indonesia, northeast of Java and Bali.</p><p>Pictures of the discovery show reddish-brown handprints — with some elongated or slightly pointed fingerprints on the cave wall.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/archaeologists-unearth-secrets-lancaster-countys-oldest-tavern-buried-centuries-pasture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH SECRETS OF LANCASTER COUNTY'S OLDEST TAVERN, BURIED FOR CENTURIES BENEATH PASTURE</u></strong></a></p><p>The prints were created by blowing pigment over hands pressed against cave walls, with some fingertips intentionally modified.</p><p>The cave art, the researchers said, is the "oldest <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archaeological evidence</a> revealed so far for the presence of our species" in the Wallacea region of Indonesia. The findings were published last week in the journal Nature. </p><p>Study author Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist at Griffith University in Australia, told The Associated Press the stencils may be evidence of a complex <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/arts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rock art tradition</a> shared across different cultures.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>Researchers still aren't sure what type of humans made the prints.</p><p>One possibility could be the Denisovans, an extinct group of early humans who lived in the region and may have interacted with Homo sapiens.</p><p>The prints could also have been made by modern humans whose ancestors <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traveled from Africa</a> through the Middle East and into Indonesia.</p><p>Researchers said they plan to continue exploring the area for even older examples of ancient art.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Independent paleoanthropologist Genevieve von Petzinger, who was not involved in the study, told The Associated Press that she "let out a little squeal of joy" when she saw the findings.</p><p>"It fits everything I'd been thinking," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The discovery</a> comes as researchers uncover increasingly older evidence of early human innovation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"For us, this discovery is not the end of the story," said Aubert.
