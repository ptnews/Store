Supporters have said the mass deportation agenda has led to self-deportation, which could account for that particular prose.</p><p>"This is massive. This means safer streets, taxpayer savings, pressure off of schools and hospital services and better job opportunities for Americans. Thank you, President Trump," Noem said.</p><p>During a visit to Arizona last year, Border Czar Tom Homan said that 90% of asylum seekers will end up with an order of removal because of a fraudulent claim.</p><p>"You can’t demand due process and ignore the decision at the end of that due process, which is an order of removal," he said at the time, according to the <a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2025/04/08/national-border-czar-tom-homan-doubles-down-on-mass-deportation-in-arizona-visit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Arizona Capitol Times</a>.</p>
