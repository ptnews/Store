The announcement comes as America's oil titans are set for high-stakes meetings with Trump at the White House to discuss the future of Venezuela's oil industry. Companies like Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are expected to meet with Trump later this week to discuss the possibility of investing billions of dollars to get the country's operations back up and running.</p><p>Following strikes on the capital and Maduro's subsequent capture, Trump said the U.S. will run <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caracas, Venezuela</a>, until a safe transition can occur, warning he was "ready to stage a second and much larger attack" on Caracas if needed.</p><p>In an interview with MS NOW host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-scarborough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Scarborough</a> Tuesday, Trump said the difference between the disaster in Iraq and the recent action in Venezuela was that former President George Bush "didn’t keep the oil."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-embraces-us-interventionism-venezuela-he-sets-sights-cuba-colombia-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP EMBRACES US INTERVENTION IN VENEZUELA, OPENS DOOR TO BROADER LATIN AMERICA PUSH</strong></a></p><p>"'We’re going to keep the oil,'" Scarborough said, quoting Trump.
