<p>The Trump administration’s military operation that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is a devastating setback to the South American nation’s long-term ally, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamic Republic of Iran</a>, experts contend.</p><p>As Iran experiences yet another day of anti-regime protests across the country, Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), who has written about Maduro’s nefarious activities, told Fox News Digital that, "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-capture-maduro-championed-condemned-across-world-stage-after-surgical-venezuela-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maduro’s capture will be</a> a blow to Iran’s interests in the Western Hemisphere as he was a longtime ally of Tehran under the banner of anti-imperialism and Americanism in the region."</p><p>He said, "How much of a blow it will be will depend on who comes to power after Maduro. Iran and Hezbollah have used Venezuela as an operational hub for terrorism, drug trafficking, and power projection in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/latin-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latin and South America</a>."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/cartel-connection-hezbollah-iran-exploit-maduros-venezuela-cocaine-cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CARTEL CONNECTION: HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN EXPLOIT MADURO’S VENEZUELA FOR COCAINE CASH</u></strong></a></p><p>He continued, "Iran had a military partnership with Caracas as well, especially with drones. So Tehran is likely eyeing these developments very warily. Its interests in the region were already weakened after Bolivia’s presidential election, which brought to power a center-right leader who reestablished relations with Israel."</p><p>In November, Fox News Digital reported that the Islamic Republic was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-backs-maduro-keep-latin-america-foothold-trump-increases-pressure-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backing Maduro</a> just as the Trump administration stepped up military pressure in the Caribbean and expanded its crackdown on criminal networks tied to the regime in Caracas.</p><p>Brodsky said, "This will be a strike heard around the world. Iran’s regime will be watching it very closely as President Trump threatened the supreme leader during the 12-Day War. This historic strike adds to the perception of President Trump being unpredictable and risk-ready, which inspires fear in U.S. adversaries and bolsters the credibility of the threat of American military force. This strengthens U.S. deterrence."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-shifts-operations-closer-us-border-israel-strikes-force-strategic-retreat-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ON MADURO’S ‘TERROR ISLAND,’ HEZBOLLAH OPERATIVES MOVE IN AS TOURISTS DRIFT OUT</strong></a></p><p>The Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it "strongly condemns the American military <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/maduros-fall-sparks-suspicion-betrayal-inside-venezuelas-ruling-elite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack on Venezuela</a> and the flagrant violation of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country."</p><p>Potkin Azarmehr, a British-Iranian expert on Iran, told Fox News Digital that "Every fall of a dictator who is allied with the Ayatollahs is both a boost to the morale of the people in Iran and a setback for the ruling mullahs."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/protests-spread-across-iran-regime-threatens-us-forces-legitimate-targets-after-trump-warning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PROTESTS SPREAD ACROSS IRAN AS REGIME THREATENS US FORCES AS 'LEGITIMATE TARGETS' AFTER TRUMP WARNING</strong></a></p><p>He added that, "The Islamic Republic saw its ‘axis of resistance’ fall apart in the region. Now it’s witnessing its partner in crime further away toppled. This will seriously damage the regime’s revenues and resources. Many of the ruling officials must now be tempted to defect before it's too late."</p><p>Iran’s axis of resistance was the troika alliance consisting of the now-defunct Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria and the weakened Hezbollah terrorist movement in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east/lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lebanon</a>.</p><p><i>Fox News' Efrat Lachter contributed to this report.</i></p>
