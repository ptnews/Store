<p>A Milwaukee police chief responded to heated criticism for attending a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/terror/counter-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counterterrorism training seminar</a> in Israel last month.</p><p>Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman attended the seminar in the first week of December. He faced opposition at a public meeting for the city's Fire and Police Commission, with residents accusing him of learning how to "oppress our communities."</p><p>"For this police chief in this political climate when there’s a genocide happening right now, to go learn tactics to further oppress our communities, is shameful," said Angela Lang, who represented Black Leaders Organizing for Communities.</p><p>"I called this trip unconscionable and I believe that with my chest," said Krissie Fung, a local resident. "I think that for many Milwaukeeans this is not something they will ever forgive."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-agrees-join-trumps-gaza-board-peace-after-initial-pushback" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NETANYAHU AGREES TO JOIN TRUMP’S GAZA BOARD OF PEACE AFTER INITIAL PUSHBACK</u></strong></a></p><p>Norman released a statement explaining his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trip to Israel,</a> but he made no apology for the decision.</p><p>"At last night’s Fire and Police Commission meeting, members of the community and various organizations shared their concerns regarding my recent training trip to Israel. I want to sincerely thank everyone who took the time to express their thoughts and experiences," he said.</p><p>"In 2025, I was invited to participate in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeland Security Program</a> in Israel, sponsored by the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) and the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA). This program, established after 9/11, facilitates the exchange of best practices between U.S. law enforcement and leading counterterrorism experts," he explained.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-world-leaders-sign-gaza-board-peace-charter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP AND WORLD LEADERS SIGN GAZA BOARD OF PEACE CHARTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"Given today’s global security challenges, I viewed this as an important opportunity to learn strategies for preventing and responding to terrorism—knowledge that ultimately enhances the safety of the entire community I serve," he said.</p><p>"As a leader, I believe in lifelong learning. Every experience, including the feedback I received last night, is part of that journey. I want to assure you that your comments were heard and taken seriously," he added.</p><p>The training in Israel was run by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former FBI Assistant Director</a> Steven Pomerantz, who said the seminar was not political in nature. He added that Israeli police have more experience than anyone in handling counterterrorism.</p><p>"The Israel national police had more experience than any other police agency in the world dealing with terrorism and a lot of lessons they had learned over the years that they were willing to share with American law enforcement," Pomerantz told <a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/milwaukee-police-chief-faces-criticism-over-training-trip-israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local Fox 6.</a></p>
