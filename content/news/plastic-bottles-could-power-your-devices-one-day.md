<p>Each year, billions of single-use plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans. That waste problem keeps growing. Now, a new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/green" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientific breakthrough</a> suggests those same bottles could help power your daily life.</p><p>Researchers have developed a way to transform discarded plastic water bottles into high-performance energy storage <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/united-nations/sustainable-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devices called supercapacitors.</a> The work focuses on PET plastic, short for polyethylene terephthalate, which is used in most beverage bottles. </p><p>The research was published in Energy &amp; Fuels and highlighted by the American Chemical Society. Scientists say the discovery could reduce plastic pollution while helping drive cleaner energy technology.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.</p><p>Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/new-tech-recovers-92-ev-battery-metals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW TECH RECOVERS 92% OF EV BATTERY METALS</strong></a></p><p>Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics. </p><p>Hu's team found a way to build these <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/components" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy storage components</a> using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.</p><p>For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.</p><p>The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/cigarette-butts-make-roads-stronger-than-ever-before" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE</strong></a></p><p>When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PET-based design</a> costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/united-nations/sustainable-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circular energy storage technologies</a> where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.</p><p>This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.</p><p><strong>Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?</strong></p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?

Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.</p><p>If your empty water bottle could one day help power your home or car, would you still see it as trash?
