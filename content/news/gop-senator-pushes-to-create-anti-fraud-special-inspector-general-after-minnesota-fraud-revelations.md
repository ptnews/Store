<p><strong>FIRST ON FOX:</strong> Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is introducing legislation to create a special inspector general to investigate federal program fraud across the country after revelations about rampant abuse <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-federal-prosecutor-who-exposed-massive-250m-minnesota-fraud-case-steps-down-from-position" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Minnesota,</a> Fox News Digital has learned.</p><p>The legislation would allow the inspector general to conduct audits and investigations as well as general oversight over federally funded child assistance programs throughout the U.S. The official would also submit quarterly reports to Congress and refer any criminal activity to the Justice Department.</p><p>"After billions of dollars have been lost to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/minnesota-fraud-exposed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraud in Minnesota,</a> American taxpayers deserve transparency and accountability to ensure their hard-earned tax dollars are not lining the pockets of bad actors," Hawley told Fox News Digital in a statement.</p><p>Hawley says the official will operate as a "federal watchdog" to "track every penny" of taxpayer funding that goes to child assistance programs.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/vance-i-think-tim-walz-should-resign-over-massive-minnesota-welfare-fraud-scandal-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VP VANCE SAYS TIM WALZ SHOULD RESIGN' OVER MASSIVE MINNESOTA WELFARE FRAUD SCANDAL INVESTIGATION</strong></a></p><p>The legislation comes as a battle rages in Minnesota over alleged fraud in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/somali-immigrant-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somali immigrant community</a> and subsequent immigration enforcement operations.</p><p>Investigators speculate the fraud could exceed $1 billion and rise as high as $9 billion.</p><p>The fraud has resulted in dozens of indictments and convictions, and it forced Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> to abandon his ambitions of seeking a third term.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-fraud-hearing-sparks-immigration-clash-gop-lawmaker-spotlights-somali-welfare-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA FRAUD HEARING SPARKS IMMIGRATION CLASH AS GOP LAWMAKER SPOTLIGHTS SOMALI WELFARE DATA</strong></a></p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/treasury-secretary-announces-cash-rewards-minnesota-fraud-whistleblowers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced cash payments</a> for fraud whistleblowers in Minnesota last week.</p><p>"We know that these rats will turn on each other," Bessent told Fox News.</p><p>"We are going to offer whistleblower payments to anyone who wants to tell us the who, what, when, where and how this fraud has been done.
