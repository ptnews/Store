<p>Excavators recently unearthed an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anglo-Saxon "princely" grave</a> — containing two men, a horse and grave goods — during the construction of a nuclear power station in England.</p><p>The discovery was made at the Sizewell C site near Theberton, Suffolk. It dates back to the 7th century A.D.</p><p>In a release, officials described the find as a "high-status grave containing two individuals buried alongside a fully harnessed horse, weapons and personal items."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/archaeologists-find-artifacts-older-than-stonehenge-beneath-britains-houses-parliament-incredibly-rare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ARCHAEOLOGISTS FIND ARTIFACTS OLDER THAN STONEHENGE BENEATH BRITAIN'S HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT: 'INCREDIBLY RARE'</strong></a></p><p>The grave goods included weaponry, shields, a bronze vessel and a silver-rimmed cup or horn — all artifacts that indicate the high status of those involved.</p><p>"These finds, dating to the 7th century, suggest the individuals were elite members of Anglo-Saxon society and reflect their complex burial traditions," the statement added.</p><p>They also found 11 barrows, or burial mounds, containing both cremation and inhumation burials.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/ancient-roman-fort-yields-2000-year-old-fruit-survived-centuries-other-treasures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ANCIENT ROMAN FORT YIELDS 2,000-YEAR-OLD FRUIT THAT SURVIVED THE CENTURIES, PLUS OTHER TREASURES</strong></a></p><p>Eerily, the skeletons have become "sand bodies" due to the soil quality, Cotswold Archaeology post-excavation project manager Chris Fern told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"What we're uncovering are 'sand bodies' rather than true skeletons — the acidic nature of Suffolk's sandy soil erodes osseous material, leading to very poor bone survival," he said.</p><p>While the discovery is significant, Fern said it's relatively normal for a small amount of Anglo-Saxon burials that are found each year <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in England.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"Each cemetery [from] this period reflects the population of a small local community," said Fern.</p><p>"In Suffolk, nearby cemeteries include those at Sutton Hoo, Snape and Rendlesham — and several are known from Ipswich."</p><p>Researchers described the grave as "princely," rather than belonging to a prince. </p><p>The term "indicates the high social status of the grave's inhabitants," Fern said.</p><p>He added that the most surprising takeaway from the excavation was that Theberton was a wealthier <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/long-lost-ancient-village-mysterious-past-unearthed-during-wind-farm-dig-exciting-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anglo-Saxon community</a> than previously believed.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"In addition, the horse burial is a rare burial rite in the period, and especially evocative, as it speaks of the special social relationship that still exists between humans and horses," Fern noted.</p><p>The burial ground dates back to a significant time in English history, when regional kingdoms started to form and consolidate power.</p><p>"A more class-conscious society [emerged] generally, as well as alongside the gradual conversion of those kingdoms from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/surprised-archaeologists-unearth-ancient-graves-caught-between-pagan-christian-rituals-poland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paganism to Christianity,</a>" the archaeologist added.</p><p>Local families would also show off their wealth in the burial rites, Fern said, as it "reflect[ed] local families in competition for social standing and leadership."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Burial was a form of powerful social and political theater," he said.</p><p>"The elaborate burials were a form of display, [and] the event was almost a form of drama."</p><p>The news comes over a year after archaeologists made a similarly significant discovery at the same site.</p><p>Excavators digging at Sizewell C found <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/ancient-treasure-dating-1000-years-found-buried-nuclear-plant-site-fascinating-find" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>321 silver coins</u></a> last year, dating back between 1036 and 1044.</p><p>The treasure was found in "mint condition" in a lead and cloth package that researchers likened to a Cornish pasty.</p>
