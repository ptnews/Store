"HE, AND HIS BROTHER, ARE TOTAL WINNERS!!!" </p><p>The Ravens stunningly fired Harbaugh Tuesday, ending a successful 18-season run. The team won six AFC North titles, appeared in four AFC championship games and won a Super Bowl under the 63-year-old.</p><p>The Ravens finished 8-9 and missed the playoffs in heartbreaking fashion when kicker Tyler Loop’s game-winning field goal attempt sailed wide right.
