<p>A surfer was bitten by a shark that broke his board in Northern California this week, in the state's first <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/sharks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shark incident</a> of the year.</p><p>"It was like being hit by a car," Tommy Civik told Bay City News, according to SFGate of the incident in Mendocino County, north of San Francisco. "All of a sudden, I was shot out of the water."</p><p>South Coast Fire Protection District Chief Jason Warner told SFGate that his team responded to a beach in Gualala, California, before 9 a.m. on Tuesday, and bystanders told him that a "big" shark "hit the surfer and the surfboard, threw the surfer up in the air a bit, and broke the board in half."</p><p>He said it "latched on to half of the board and [was] kind of thrashing it around."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/swimmer-vanishes-after-possible-shark-encounter-off-california-coast-during-group-outing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SWIMMER VANISHES AFTER POSSIBLE SHARK ENCOUNTER OFF CALIFORNIA COAST DURING GROUP OUTING</strong></a></p><p>Civik told the Los Angeles Times that he never saw the shark.</p><p>"My board snapped in half on impact," he said. "My friend watching said that I flew in the air. I’m still piecing together what happened.… The whole thing was so jarring, I was just trying to get away."</p><p>Peter Tira with the California Department of Fish <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Wildlife</a> told SFGate that Civik needed stitches and DNA from his wound will be used to identify what type of shark attacked him.</p><p>"I was unbelievably lucky," Civik told The Times. "My board took all the impact, and the teeth just grazed me," Civik said. "I had quite a bit of adrenaline, and since I could walk, I drove myself to the hospital."</p><p>His friend Marco Guerrero told the Times he saw the shark attacking what he at first thought was a seal.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-woman-killed-us-virgin-islands-shark-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA WOMAN KILLED IN US VIRGIN ISLANDS SHARK ATTACK </strong></a></p><p> "I just remember Tommy saying, ‘I’ll meet you out there,’ and suiting up. I was looking out at the waves when I saw the thrashing," he explained. "I said, ‘Oh that’s a shark attack,’ thinking it was attacking a seal. I didn’t realize it was Tommy."</p><p>After the attack, Civik said he "just put [his] head down and swam, fast."</p><p>"I didn’t know where the shark was, so I just focused on getting away," he told The Times. "After a minute, I realized that if the shark [had] wanted to bite me again, it would’ve. It all happened so fast."</p><p>Civik’s attack comes less than a month after an open ocean swimmer was killed by a shark in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Cruz County</a>, and following a record year for shark incidents in 2025.</p><p>"However, there were only 3 incidents with injuries last year, far below the highest year, which was 1974 with 7 injuries confirmed," Tira told SFGate.</p>
