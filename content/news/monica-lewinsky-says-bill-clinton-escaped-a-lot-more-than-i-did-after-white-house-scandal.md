<p>Monica Lewinsky reflected on the unwanted fame she received after her affair with former President Bill Clinton was unearthed.</p><p>Nearly three decades ago, Lewinsky, a former White House intern, had an affair with the former president while he was in office. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/the-clintons" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Clinton</u></a> subsequently had an impeachment trial that came about in December 1998.</p><p>Lewinsky contemplated suicide due to the media scrutiny, and told <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/monica-lewinsky-interview-bill-clinton-affair-abuse-power-kssbk7w33?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfPyHX0vieIZoxL9O-g-GKP8fKbLs1K9WTIF_sL1msGK-1Ne_-cox5w4h3VZJ8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=696512d2&amp;gaa_sig=fjcGc6Hdu9UquwZyNiXR-Qjgg7tGNt_M0sa2FyLc1MWhfZhQRyklIbFf0MTYCWC4vZnTiHSTZKOvirqe8b4euQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Times</a> that "the public humiliation was excruciating; life was almost unbearable."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/monica-lewinsky-leaves-clinton-scandal-dust-joins-hollywood-elite-bold-new-look-business-venture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MONICA LEWINSKY LEAVES CLINTON SCANDAL IN DUST, JOINS HOLLYWOOD ELITE WITH BOLD NEW LOOK, BUSINESS VENTURE</strong></a></p><p>While her personal fallout almost cost her life, Lewinsky believed Clinton "escaped" from overwhelming criticism more easily than she did.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/monica-lewinsky-goes-viral-taylor-swift-themed-bill-clinton-joke-asylum-raised" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MONICA LEWINSKY GOES VIRAL FOR TAYLOR SWIFT-THEMED BILL CLINTON JOKE: ‘THE ASYLUM WHERE THEY RAISED ME’</strong></a></p><p>"I haven’t spoken to him in almost 30 years and I don’t know what his internal landscape is," she said. "I think he escaped a lot more than I did."</p><p>Clinton was 49 at the time of the incident, while Lewinsky was 22.</p><p>Lewinsky maintained that their relationship was consensual, however "this was a gross abuse of power. Full stop."</p><p>She added, "That doesn’t mean I didn’t make mistakes, that I didn’t make wrong choices, that my behavior didn’t hurt other people. But at the heart of it was a gross abuse of power."</p><p>Following the scandal, Clinton was acquitted. After a few public appearances in an attempt to reinvent herself, Lewinsky disappeared from the spotlight in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Lewinsky reclaimed some of the narrative surrounding her story and served as a producer on the FX series, "Impeachment: American Crime Story."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>In 2018, the former president bristled at questions over whether he should have resigned over his sexual relationship with Lewinsky and whether the #MeToo movement has changed his perspective.</p><p>"I dealt with it 20 years ago, plus," said Clinton on NBC’s "Today Show." "And the American people, two-thirds of them stayed with me. And I’ve tried to do a good job since then, and with my life and with my work. That’s all I have to say."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

"Or to find a way of staying in office that was not lying and not throwing a young person who is just starting out in the world under the bus."</p><p>She added, "At the same time, I hear myself say that, and it’s like, ‘Okay, but we’re also talking about the most powerful office in the world.' I don’t want to be naive either."</p><p>Lewinsky also reflected on the White House response, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/monica-lewinsky-says-she-was-gutted-after-bill-clinton-labeled-her-that-woman-in-doc-i-felt-anger" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>when Clinton denied the affair</u></a> by saying, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." Cooper asked Lewinsky to reconcile what people were saying about their relationship, and what she knew to be true.</p><p>"It was gaslighting," she said. "I think that was what I experienced on a pretty large scale. It was devastating."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/monica-lewinsky-sets-social-media-ablaze-with-perfect-response-to-high-risk-low-reward-question" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Lewinsky also said</u></a> that while she felt Clinton's behavior was worse, she still made her own mistakes. </p><p>"Let's recognize that while there were so many ways that Bill's behavior was more reprehensible than mine, I did make mistakes," she said.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Janelle Ash contributed to this report.</i></p>
