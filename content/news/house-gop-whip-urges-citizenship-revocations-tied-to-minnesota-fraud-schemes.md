<p>The No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives believes it’s time to deport Somalis who participated in expansive fraud in Minnesota – even if they hold citizenship. </p><p>"I have three words regarding Somalis who have committed fraud against American taxpayers: Send them home," Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said in a press release Monday evening.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/loeffler-vast-network-somali-nonprofits-ripped-off-minnesotas-welfare-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LOEFFLER: VAST NETWORK OF SOMALI NONPROFITS RIPPED OFF MINNESOTA’S WELFARE STATE</strong></a></p><p>"If they’re here illegally, deport them immediately; if they’re naturalized citizens, revoke their citizenship and deport them quickly thereafter. If we need to change the law to do that, I will."</p><p>Emmer’s statement comes after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmakers-probe-sba-loans-linked-to-minnesotas-9b-fraud-scandal-reckless-decision-making">recent revelations</a> that fraud schemes targeting government benefit programs in the North Star State may have robbed taxpayers of up to $9 billion. </p><p>In recent months, investigators have uncovered sweeping fraud schemes masquerading as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/unearthed-surveillance-exposes-how-parents-allegedly-involved-minnesotas-daycare-fraud-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daycare centers</a>, medical providers and food assistance programs, siphoning millions in government funds by fabricating services or inflating the number of people they claimed to serve.</p><p>According to Emmer, 90% of the people charged with fraud have a Somali background.</p><p>"Our nation will not tolerate those who take advantage of our charity and refuse to assimilate into our culture," Emmer said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/state-officials-daycare-manager-push-back-viral-video-fraud-allegations-minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STATE OFFICIALS AND DAYCARE MANAGER PUSH BACK ON VIRAL VIDEO FRAUD ALLEGATIONS IN MINNESOTA</strong></a></p><p>While federal and congressional investigations continue to work through numerous schemes, one of the more troubling questions about the fraud is about where the money could end up. City Journal, a national magazine, <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/minnesota-welfare-fraud-somalia-al-shabaab">first reported</a> that some of those funds could have gone to Al-Shabaab – an Islamic terror group with ties to al Qaeda.</p><p>While the group also operates out of Kenya and Ethiopia, Al-Shabaab is primarily concentrated in Somalia.</p><p>"If any naturalized Somalis had undisclosed ties to terrorist organizations like Al-Shabaab, I want to see their citizenship revoked and their a--es sent back immediately. Same goes for anyone who is found to have committed marriage fraud during the immigration process," Emmer said.</p><p>Under current law, U.S. citizens born into the country may not have their citizenship revoked as a penalty for crimes they commit. Naturalized citizens can have their status revoked, but only in a handful of scenarios.</p><p>Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, naturalized immigrants can only have their <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1451&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">citizenship revoked</a> if they misrepresented their record in the application, such as hiding criminal histories or using a fake identity.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/unearthed-surveillance-exposes-how-parents-allegedly-involved-minnesotas-daycare-fraud-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UNEARTHED SURVEILLANCE EXPOSES HOW PARENTS WERE ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN MINNESOTA'S DAYCARE FRAUD SCHEME</strong></a></p><p>Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced it would review the constitutionality of an executive order from President Donald Trump that aims to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-fight-heads-back-supreme-court-new-term-begins">exclude children</a> born to parents with temporary or unlawful status from U.S. citizenship.</p><p>The court will hear that case in spring 2026. </p>
