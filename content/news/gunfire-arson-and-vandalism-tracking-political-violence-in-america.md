<p>Assassination attempts, arson attacks and targeted shootings have scarred American politics over the past three years.</p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> survived two incidents. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was unharmed after a madman lit his house on fire. UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson died after a gunman shot him in the back on a Manhattan sidewalk. A sniper killed Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk during a public speaking event. Even state-level officials have been gunned down in their own homes.</p><p>Experts warn that political violence and tolerance for it are on the rise, even with the murder rate falling to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/murder-rate-drops-lowest-level-since-1900-across-major-us-cities-nationwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">125-year low</a> in 2025. And victims have been on both sides of the political spectrum. </p><p>Here's a recap of events.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-california-bill-named-after-charlie-kirk-melissa-hortman-adds-political-affiliation-hate-crimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW CALIFORNIA BILL NAMED AFTER CHARLIE KIRK, MELISSA HORTMAN ADDS 'POLITICAL AFFILIATION' TO HATE CRIMES</strong></a></p><p>Thomas Crooks, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 20-year-old Pennsylvanian</a>, opened fire from a rooftop overlooking a campaign rally for President Donald Trump in Butler, a rural area near Pittsburgh.</p><p>A bullet grazed Trump's ear. Two members of the audience survived gunshot wounds and one man, a 50-year-old firefighter and father of two named <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hero-trump-rally-victim-corey-comperatore-died-shielding-family-wouldve-done-again-friend-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corey Comperatore,</a> died.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-surveillance-video-shows-pennsylvania-governors-mansion-arson-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR'S MANSION ARSON ATTACK</strong></a></p><p>"Corey died a hero," Shapiro told reporters after speaking with Comperatore's wife Helen. "Corey dove on his family to protect them."</p><p>Authorities have released few details about Crooks and his motive. He died when counter-snipers returned fire.</p><p>"As the survivor of two assassination attempts — and recently watching his dear friend Charlie be assassinated — no one understands the dangers of political violence more than President Trump," White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital last week. "That’s why, following Charlie’s assassination, President Trump delivered powerful and unifying remarks urging all Americans to ‘commit themselves to the American values for which Charlie Kirk lived and died. The values of free speech, citizenship, the rule of law, and the patriotic devotion and love of God.’"</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/conservative-utah-student-says-radical-left-wing-classmate-threatened-kirk-him-before-campus-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CONSERVATIVE UTAH STUDENT SAYS RADICAL LEFT-WING CLASSMATE THREATENED TO 'KIRK' HIM BEFORE CAMPUS ARREST</strong></a></p><p>Police arrested a 58-year-old man after U.S. Secret Service agents spotted a rifle barrel poking through the brush on the edge of Trump International Golf Club in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Palm Beach, Florida</a>, while Trump was playing a round.</p><p>Jurors found Ryan Wesley Routh, now 59, guilty in September.
