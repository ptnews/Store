A meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what is happening before the meeting, but a meeting is being set up. Iran called, they want to negotiate," Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.</p><p>While airstrikes were one of many alternatives open to Trump, "diplomacy is always the first option for the president," White House press secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/karoline-leavitt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karoline Leavitt</a> told reporters.</p><p>"What you're hearing publicly from the Iranian regime is quite different from the messages the administration is receiving privately, and I think the president has an interest in exploring those messages," Leavitt said.</p>
