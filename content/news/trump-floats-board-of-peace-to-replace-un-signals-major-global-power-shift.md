<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> has suggested his proposed "Board of Peace" in Gaza could replace the U.N., underscoring what one national security analyst has described as a revision of the "existing international order."</p><p>Asked Tuesday whether he envisioned the new body supplanting the U.N., Trump replied, "It might."</p><p>Speaking at a White House press conference, the president also told reporters the U.N. has consistently failed to fulfill its mission.</p><p>"The UN just hasn’t been very helpful. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/united-nations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the UN, but</a> it has never lived up to its potential," Trump said. While arguing the U.N. should continue to exist, he added, "The UN should have settled every one of the wars that I settled."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trumps-peace-through-strength-2025-where-wars-stopped-rivals-came-table" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP’S PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH IN 2025: WHERE WARS STOPPED AND RIVALS CAME TO THE TABLE</strong></a></p><p>National security analyst Kobi Michael claimed the proposal already signaled a break with the international order that has defined global politics for decades.</p><p>"The norms, international institutions and organizations and liberalism are out, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/geopolitics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real politics, interests and power</a> are in," <a href="https://www.inss.org.il/person/michaelkobi/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Prof. Kobi Michael</a>, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute, told Fox News Digital, before adding that "the EU is much less important."</p><p>Michael's comments come as the Trump administration moved forward with plans for the board, an initiative officials say extends far beyond the immediate conflict in the Gaza Strip.</p><p>In a statement Jan. 16, the White House said, in alignment with the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, the "Board of Peace will play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the President’s plan, providing strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-officials-tout-progress-talks-reach-lasting-durable-peace-between-ukraine-russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US OFFICIALS TOUT PROGRESS IN TALKS TO REACH 'LASTING AND DURABLE PEACE' BETWEEN UKRAINE, RUSSIA</strong></a></p><p>As previously reported by Fox News Digital, preparations are said to be underway for a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-seeks-davos-signing-ceremony-gaza-board-peace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing ceremony in Davos</a>, Switzerland with Bloomberg first reporting the plans.</p><p>"Dozens" of countries were invited, officials confirmed, with formal invitations sent Friday.
