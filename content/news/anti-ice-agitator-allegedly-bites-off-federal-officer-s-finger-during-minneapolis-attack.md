<p>Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin shared a photo on social media Saturday of a federal <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law enforcement officer</a>'s severed finger after an anti-ICE agitator in Minneapolis allegedly bit it off.</p><p>"In Minneapolis, these rioters attacked our law enforcement officer and one of them bit off our HSI officer’s finger," McLaughlin wrote in the post. "He will lose his finger."</p><p>She shared photos of two people seemingly in custody, though it is unclear which person is the alleged biter.</p><p>Additional details about the assault have not yet been released, though ongoing protests have escalated after the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cites-armed-suspect-lack-police-support-following-fatal-border-patrol-shooting-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deaths of two U.S. citizens</a> during immigration enforcement operations in the blue city.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-says-2-demonstrators-were-arrested-minnesota-allegedly-assaulting-officers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE SAYS 2 DEMONSTRATORS WERE ARRESTED IN MINNESOTA FOR ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING OFFICERS</strong></a></p><p>Hours before McLaughlin's post, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Border Patrol agent</a> was captured on video fatally shooting an armed man in Minneapolis amid a crowd of agitators.</p><p>The 37-year-old man, a U.S. citizen from Minneapolis, allegedly approached agents and then "violently resisted," while armed with a 9 mm pistol and two magazines, according to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeland Security officials</a>.</p><p>Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said during a news conference Saturday it "look[ed] like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-allegedly-assaulted-flagpole-minneapolis-anti-ice-agitators-violent-parking-garage-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MAN ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTED WITH FLAGPOLE BY MINNEAPOLIS ANTI-ICE AGITATORS IN VIOLENT PARKING GARAGE ATTACK</strong></a></p><p>"About 200 rioters arrived at the scene and began to obstruct and assault law enforcement," Bovino said.
