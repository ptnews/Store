"The high of impeachment declarations and jail just don’t give them the same high anymore. Now we have Democrats running on killing the President. This guy belongs in an insane asylum."</p><p>Some called for Ohio Democrats to disavow Forhan and others highlighted Democratic attorney general Jay Jones being recently elected in Virginia despite calling for the murder of his political opponent.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/assassination-culture-rise-especially-among-women-study-warns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'ASSASSINATION CULTURE' IS ON THE RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG WOMEN, STUDY WARNS</strong></a></p><p>"Democrats, your silence is telling," Ohio Republican treasurer candidate Jay Edwards <a href="https://x.com/JayEdwardsOhio/status/2016331033524728295?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>posted on X</u>,</a> calling the comment "unhinged."</p><p>"Dr. Amy Acton and Sherrod Brown—disavow this extremist now, or admit you’re okay with this violent hate in your party."</p><p>"That is normalizing political murder," Ohio Republican attorney Mehek Cooke <a href="https://x.com/MehekCooke/status/2016307621809004574?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>posted on X</u></a>.

He does not believe in the truth or the rule of law. He asks Ohioans to disbelieve what they saw with their own eyes, that an ICE officer killed Renee Good without justification, shooting her twice in the face after he was clear of her vehicle. Keith Faber wrote, ‘In Minneapolis, ICE agents were doing their jobs.’ Was the ICE officer who shot Alex Pretti 10 times doing his job? No. ICE is not enforcing the law. They are breaking the law. Mr. Faber is telling Ohioans that, if elected, he will let Trump get away with murder. Ohio voters should take Mr. Faber at his word."</p>
