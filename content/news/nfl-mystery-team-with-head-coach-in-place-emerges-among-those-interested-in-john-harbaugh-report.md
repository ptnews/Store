"Today I informed John that he has been relieved of his duties.</p><p>"This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, most importantly, as a great man of integrity."</p><p>The Ravens also posted a statement from Harbaugh. </p><p>"Well, I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today. It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE &amp; APPRECIATION," Harbaugh said.</p><p>"Gratitude to the owner and organization who was willing to bring in a head coach who made his mark with Special Teams success. A difficult thing to do… and Appreciation for all the moments, all these years, that are etched into eternity. I hope a legacy built on Faith, always Fighting, always Believing."</p><p>Harbaugh owned a 180-113 record and a 13-11 postseason record during his 18 seasons with the franchise. He led the Ravens to a Super Bowl victory during the 2012 season after going 10-6.</p><p>Harbaugh, the brother of Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh, has the most road playoff victories in NFL history, showcasing his pedigree when the game matters most.</p><p>Through his 18 seasons, Harbaugh has only had a losing record three times, with his worst mark being the 2015 campaign at 5-11. The other two were 8-9 seasons in 2021 and 2025.</p><p>Harbaugh secured double-digit victories in 11 of those 18 seasons, including three straight from 2022-24.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
