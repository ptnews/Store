<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/nasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA carried out</a> its first medical evacuation from space early Thursday, bringing four astronauts back to Earth more than a month early after a crew member reported health issues aboard the International Space Station.</p><p>SpaceX guided the Dragon capsule to a nighttime splashdown in the Pacific Ocean <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/san-diego" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off the coast of San Diego</a>, completing the return less than 11 hours after the crew departed the orbiting laboratory.</p><p>"Splashdown of Dragon confirmed – welcome back to Earth, @zenanaut, @AstroIronMike, @Astro_Kimiya, and Oleg!" SpaceX said in a post on X.</p><p>NASA said the affected astronaut was stable while in orbit, but that mission managers <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nasa-administrator-orders-early-return-4-crew-11-astronauts-medical-situation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided an early return</a> was the safest course to allow for proper medical evaluation and diagnostic testing on Earth. </p><p>Officials emphasized that the return did not require any special procedures and that standard medical teams were on hand during recovery.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nasa-makes-unprecedented-call-bring-astronauts-home-after-illness-expert-says-evacuated-from-orbit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NASA MAKES ‘UNPRECEDENTED’ CALL TO BRING ASTRONAUTS HOME AFTER ILLNESS, EXPERT SAYS: ‘EVACUATED FROM ORBIT’</strong></a></p><p>The mission’s early conclusion left the space station temporarily staffed by just three astronauts — one American and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two Russians</a> — a configuration NASA said is manageable but limits some operations. </p><p>Agency officials said no spacewalks, including emergency repairs, can be conducted until the arrival of the next crew.</p><p>NASA stressed that the decision was precautionary and not the result of an emergency. The health issue emerged on Jan. 7, prompting the cancellation of a scheduled spacewalk the following day and ultimately <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/nasa-weighs-cutting-short-international-space-station-mission-due-astronaut-medical-issue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading to the shortened mission</a>.</p><p>It marked the first time NASA has cut short a spaceflight for medical reasons, though similar decisions were made by Russian space programs decades ago.</p><p>NASA and SpaceX said they are working to move up the launch of a replacement crew of four, currently scheduled for mid-February. </p>
