<p>Former CBS News journalists are reportedly planning to urge Paramount CEO David Ellison to ensure CBS News Editor-in-Chief <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/2025-review-tumultuous-year-paramount-cbs-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bari Weiss</a> respects "editorial independence," but an ex-staffer feels the polarizing news chief is simply doing what she was hired to do. </p><p>Weiss, who was handpicked by Ellison and has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bari-weiss-reportedly-stunned-60-minutes-crew-asking-why-country-thinks-theyre-biased-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irked some insiders</a> by noting a lack of faith from the public in CBS and other mainstream media institutions, made headlines last week by delaying a "60 Minutes" segment on Trump deportations to an El Salvador prison, CECOT. </p><p>Hours before "Inside CECOT" was set to air, "60 Minutes" released a statement saying the segment was being delayed because it needed "additional reporting." The decision to delay the segment irritated many, including "60 Minutes" correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who accused Weiss of holding it for political reasons.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bari-weiss-suggests-cecot-60-minutes-piece-she-delayed-wasnt-fair-memo-staffers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BARI WEISS SUGGESTS CECOT '60 MINUTES' PIECE SHE DELAYED WASN'T 'FAIR' IN MEMO TO STAFFERS</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/29/media/cbs-news-journalists-to-urge-david-ellison-to-protect-independence-after-bari-weiss-pulled-60-minutes-report-on-salvadoran-prison/?utm_source=www.status.news&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=hollywood-s-international-divide&amp;_bhlid=7365ffd3d727de95248a642785c046a227928fde" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Post</a> reported on Monday that former CBS News journalists are preparing a petition to Ellison, urging him to make sure CBS News respects "editorial independence." The petition, which will reportedly be sent to Ellison on Jan. 3, states that Weiss’ decision to hold the story "signals a breakdown in editorial oversight, and risks setting a dangerous precedent in a country that has traditionally valued press freedom," according to the Post. </p><p>A former CBS News journalist, who has not been asked to sign the letter, doesn’t believe it will move the needle. </p><p>"I doubt it’ll have much impact on Ellison because I think he hired her to do exactly what she’s doing – even if not in the ham-fisted and self-destructive way she’s doing it," the former CBS News staffer told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a>. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/60-minutes-reporter-lashes-out-bari-weiss-after-segment-el-salvador-prison-yanked-last-minute" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>'60 MINUTES' REPORTER LASHES OUT AT BARI WEISS AFTER SEGMENT ON EL SALVADOR PRISON YANKED AT LAST MINUTE</u></strong></a></p><p>"I think they’d be better off asking her for a face-to-face meeting," they continued. "That’d be a ‘town hall’ that might have an impact." </p><p>CBS News and Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>In August, Ellison officially became the owner and CEO of Paramount, now formally referred to as "Paramount, a Skydance company." He handpicked Weiss to oversee CBS News, acquiring her outlet The Free Press for $150 million in the process. </p><p>Weiss decided to delay the "60 Minutes" segment after determining that, while the interviews were "powerful," the story ultimately did not "advance the ball" and "was not ready." Among her notes were urging more effort to get a Trump official on-camera to defend administration policies on immigration, as well as criticizing a "strange" portion of the segment showing Berkeley students analyzing the prison.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/stephen-miller-calls-fire-cbs-producers-over-shelved-trump-deportation-story-segment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>STEPHEN MILLER CALLS FOR FIRING OF CBS PRODUCERS OVER SHELVED TRUMP DEPORTATION STORY SEGMENT</u></strong></a></p><p>The segment that leaked online did not include any interviews with Trump officials or administration statements beyond a brief clip of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and another clip of President Donald Trump praising El Salvador's prison system.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/22/60-minutes-episode-leaked" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Axios reported</a> that the White House, Department of Homeland Security and State Department all provided <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-didnt-include-white-house-statement-about-angel-parents-delayed-cecot-segment-60-minutes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statements to CBS,</a> but none of them were included in the story. </p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s David Rutz and Taylor Penley contributed to this report. </i></p>
