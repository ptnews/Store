<p>Two key economic policy decisions are on the horizon in Washington: a Supreme Court ruling on tariffs and the White House’s expected announcement of the next <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/the-fed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Federal Reserve</u></a> chair. Both developments carry significant implications for trade, markets and the future of U.S. monetary policy.</p><p>At the Supreme Court, two cases, which President <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Donald Trump</u></a> has called "life or death" for the U.S., have forced the nation's highest court to confront how far a president can go in redirecting U.S. trade policy.</p><p>The suits — Learning Resources Inc. v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections Inc. — were brought by an educational-toy manufacturer and a family-owned wine and spirits importer challenging Trump’s tariffs.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/perception-vs-reality-trumps-economy-gains-steam-faces-messaging-test-stephen-moore-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>‘PERCEPTION VS. REALITY’: TRUMP’S ECONOMY PICKS UP SPEED — BUT VOTERS AREN’T BUYING IT YET</strong></a></p><p>Both cases turn on a central question: whether the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-prepares-confront-monumental-case-trump-executive-power-tariff-authority" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)</u></a> gave the president authority to impose the tariffs, or whether that move crossed constitutional lines.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-defends-tariffs-says-us-has-been-the-king-being-screwed-trade-imbalance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP DEFENDS TARIFFS, SAYS US HAS BEEN ‘THE KING OF BEING SCREWED’ BY TRADE IMBALANCE</u></strong></a></p><p>Tariffs are taxes the government places on imported goods. Although companies pay these taxes at the border, they often cover the added cost by raising prices, which means consumers ultimately shoulder much of the burden. </p><p>Since Trump announced sweeping "Liberation Day" tariffs in April, total <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-tariffs-haul-over-200b-revenues-supreme-court-weighs-challenge-legality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>duty revenue</u></a> has climbed to $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30, according to the Treasury Department’s Customs and Certain Excise Taxes report.</p><p>That revenue strength has carried well into the new fiscal year. Since Oct. 1, the government has collected $96.5 billion in duties, according to Treasury's latest statement.</p><p>Meanwhile, two candidates are vying for a role that would shape the direction of U.S. monetary policy: Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh.</p><p>The appointment to lead the world’s most powerful central bank comes as persistently high living costs test Trump’s <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/bessent-wraps-up-fed-chair-interviews-trumps-decision-expected-before-christmas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>economic agenda</u></a>.
