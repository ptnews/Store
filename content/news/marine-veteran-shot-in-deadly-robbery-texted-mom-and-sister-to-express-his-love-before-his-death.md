"He played a big role in me staying sober. He would remind me of God's love and always motivated me to keep it up. He didn't have to reach out to check in, but he did. Looking to meet up or get me to church, he was always trying to show me the light. Getting messages or calls from Ryan kept me in the fight and helped me through the darkness. And for that, I'll be forever grateful."</p>
