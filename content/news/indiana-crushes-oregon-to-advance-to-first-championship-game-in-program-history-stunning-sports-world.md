<p>The 2025 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/indiana-hoosiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Hoosiers</a> became the fifth team in college football history to go 15-0. Now they can become the second team ever to go 16-0, joining only a 1894 Yale team that played with leather helmets. </p><p>With a merciless 56-22 thumping <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/oregon-ducks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of Oregon</a> in the Peach Bowl, the Hoosiers punched their ticket to their first national championship game appearance in program history. </p><p>Head coach Curt Cignetti has left the college football world breathless with a dramatic turnaround of the Hoosiers program, going from one of the losingest teams in the Big 10 to potentially the most dominant single-season of all time. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p><p>Many prominent sports figures took to social media to express their amazement of Indiana's unprecedented dominance during and after their win over Oregon. Indiana Gov. Mike Braun also chimed in. </p><p>Indiana's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/indianas-fernando-mendoza-wins-2025-heisman-trophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback</a> Fernando Mendoza threw five touchdown passes, improving his case to be the top pick in the upcoming NFL Draft. </p><p>Kaelon Black ran for two touchdowns to lead the Indiana running game.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/indiana-wins-first-outright-big-10-football-championship-since-1945-after-ohio-state-flubs-short-field-goal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>INDIANA WINS FIRST OUTRIGHT BIG 10 FOOTBALL TITLE SINCE 1945 AFTER OHIO STATE FLUBS SHORT FIELD GOAL TRY</strong></a></p><p>Oregon (13-2, No. 5 CFP) was doomed by the three first-half turnovers while also being short-handed by the absence of two of their top running backs.</p><p>Indiana’s defense didn’t wait long to make an impact. On Oregon’s first snap, cornerback D’Angelo Ponds intercepted Moore’s pass intended for Malik Benson and returned the pick 25 yards for a touchdown. Only 11 seconds into the game, the Hoosiers and their defense already had made a statement this would be a long night for Moore and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/oregon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon offense</a>.</p><p>Moore’s 19-yard scoring pass to tight end Jamari Johnson tied the game. The remainder of the half belonged to Indiana and its big-play defense.</p><p>After Mendoza’s 8-yard touchdown pass to Omar Cooper Jr. gave the Hoosiers the lead for good at 14-7, Indiana’s defense forced a turnover when Moore fumbled and Indiana recovered at the Oregon 3, setting up Black’s scoring run.</p><p>Moore lost a second fumble later in the second quarter when <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://x.com/i/status/2009808787105001490" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>hit by Daniel Ndukwe</u></a> and Mario Landino recovered at the Oregon 21. Mendoza’s first scoring pass to Sarratt gave the Hoosiers’ the 35-7 lead.</p><p>Indiana extended its lead to 42-7 on Mendoza’s 13-yard scoring pass to E.J. Williams Jr.</p><p>Oregon finally answered. A 70-yard run by Hill set up a 2-yard scoring run by Harris.</p><p>The Hoosiers led 35-7 at halftime as the Ducks were held to nine rushing yards on 17 carries. Noah Whittington, who leads Oregon with 829 rushing yards, was held out with an undisclosed injury after Jordon Davison, who had rushed for 667 yards and 15 touchdowns, already was <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://undefined/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>listed as out</u></a> with a collarbone injury.</p><p>Backup running backs, including Jay Harris and Dierre Hill Jr, provided too little help for quarterback Dante Moore. Moore’s task against Indiana’s stifling defense would have been daunting even with all his weapons.</p><p>Following their undefeated regular season, the Hoosiers have only gained momentum in the CFP. Indiana <a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" href="https://apnews.com/article/rose-bowl-indiana-alabama-score-cfp-86520296479531ebf7c16ecd56b7879b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>overwhelmed Alabama 38-3</u></a> in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal as Mendoza passed for 192 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p>Now, the Hoosiers will prepare to face Miami on Jan. 19 in the national championship game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/miami-beats-ole-miss-behind-carson-becks-game-winning-touchdown-reach-cfp-national-championship-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami beat Mississippi</a> 31-27 in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday night.</p><p>Indiana will try to give the Big Ten its third straight national title, following Ohio State and Michigan the last two seasons.
