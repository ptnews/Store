<p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/middle-east" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muslim-majority country in the Middle East</a> will no longer sponsor students seeking to study abroad in Britain, claiming that it fears students will become radicalized.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates believes that its students in Britain could be subject to indoctrination and radicalization by the Muslim Brotherhood, according to London-based news outlet <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/education/article/uae-limiting-students-coming-to-uk-over-muslim-brotherhood-concerns-zvpdd6fqn?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqc0spmJcNYZeBEucErTMHQ6iCtJvanCklgSsjJVRIPJkxogu-avozTFkR7BLeA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69614113&amp;gaa_sig=x99uGKXW3xO6B_uGNZmdUxz5pYJC1gGhnk9JUc1JonAZRoUl214i01hAbTNmpH4l83LoQwIrCt4TWeQlfzIvjg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Times</a>.</p><p>In the UAE and several other Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, the Muslim Brotherhood has been designated as a terror organization. </p><p>Some Central Asian countries have also given it that designation. In Texas and Florida, the Muslim Brotherhood has been labeled a terror group, though the federal government has not labeled it as such.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-releases-body-cam-video-deadly-syria-raid-targeting-muslim-brotherhood-affiliated-terrorists" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ISRAEL RELEASES BODY-CAM VIDEO OF DEADLY SYRIA RAID TARGETING MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD-AFFILIATED TERRORISTS</strong></a></p><p>The Emirati Ministry of Education and Ministry of Foreign Affairs offer funding to cover "tuition, living stipends, travel and health insurance for top-performing students who are pursuing degrees in priority fields," according to the report.</p><p>It will still offer its robust state-sponsored study abroad program for students who wish to study in other countries.</p><p>The country has not completely banned <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studying in Britain,</a> according to the report, but those who wish to do so will have to pay their own way.</p><p>The UAE has battled against the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East for years. In 2013, it backed Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who overthrew a Muslim Brotherhood-linked regime, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-foreign-policy-spotlight-after-yemen-escalation-2025-12-31/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Reuters</a>.</p><p>It has also worked with proxies to undermine the Muslim Brotherhood in Yemen and the African countries of Chad and Sudan.</p><p>In 2015, an inquiry by the British government determined that the Islamist group is contrary to British values and that membership in the group could be a sign of extremism. Still, the country did not designate it as a terror group.</p><p>Certain Muslim interest groups in the U.K., including the Muslim Association of Britain, the British Muslim Initiative and the Islamic Society of Britain have been suspected of being linked to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/islam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muslim Brotherhood ideology</a>.</p>
