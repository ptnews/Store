<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s office is pushing back against fraud allegations after a viral video showed visits to multiple childcare centers in the state, including one that allegedly received millions of dollars in state funding despite appearing largely inactive.</p><p>Responding to questions about the allegations and the video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley, a spokesperson for the governor told Fox News that Walz has spent years working to "crack down on fraud" and has taken steps to strengthen oversight of state programs, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/investigations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initiating investigations</a> into several facilities.</p><p>"The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governor has</a> worked for years to crack down on fraud and ask the state legislature for more authority to take aggressive action," the spokesperson said. "He has strengthened oversight — including launching investigations into these specific facilities, one of which was already closed."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmakers-probe-sba-loans-linked-to-minnesotas-9b-fraud-scandal-reckless-decision-making" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LAWMAKERS PROBE SBA LOANS LINKED TO MINNESOTA’S $9B FRAUD SCANDAL: 'RECKLESS DECISION MAKING'</strong></a></p><p>The spokesperson added that Walz has "hired an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs, shut down the Housing Stabilization Services program entirely, announced a new statewide program integrity director, and supported criminal prosecutions."</p><p>The response follows the release of a 42-minute video by Shirley, posted Friday on X and YouTube, documenting visits to several <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daycare centers in the blue state</a>, including a location on Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis.</p><p>In the video, Shirley and another man are seen at what appears to be a largely inactive childcare facility. The building also displays a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/misspelled-learning-center-no-children-inside-emmer-presses-walz-over-minnesota-daycare-tied-4m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misspelled sign reading</a> "Quality Learing Center," even though the center is reportedly supposed to account for 99 children and received roughly $4 million in state funds.</p><p>During a Sunday appearance on Fox News' "The Big Weekend Show," Shirley said the alleged fraud in Minnesota was "so obvious" that a "kindergartner could figure out that there is fraud going on."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-surges-resources-minnesota-director-patel-calls-250m-fraud-scheme-tip-iceberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FBI SURGES RESOURCES TO MINNESOTA AS DIRECTOR PATEL CALLS $250M FRAUD SCHEME ‘TIP OF A VERY LARGE ICEBERG’</strong></a></p><p>Shirley also suggested other journalists may be reluctant to pursue similar reporting out of fear of being labeled "Islamophobic" or "racist."</p><p>"Fraud is fraud, and we work too hard simply just to be paying taxes and enabling fraud to be happening," he said. </p><p>The video has sparked widespread backlash, drawing criticism of Walz throughout the weekend from several high-profile figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., Donald Trump Jr. and Elon Musk.</p><p>The White House on Sunday reposted an X post from Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who called the alleged fraud a "breathtaking failure that has happened under the watch" of Walz.</p><p>Meanwhile, FBI Director <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kash-patel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kash Patel</a> said the agency has surged additional personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota as part of an ongoing effort to "dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/misspelled-learning-center-no-children-inside-emmer-presses-walz-over-minnesota-daycare-tied-4m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MISSPELLED LEARNING CENTER, NO CHILDREN INSIDE: EMMER PRESSES WALZ OVER MINNESOTA DAYCARE TIED TO $4M</strong></a></p><p>The video went viral this week amid the burgeoning scandal enveloping the Walz administration that notably included at least $1 billion lost to alleged social services fraud largely tied to the Somali community in the Twin Cities.</p><p><i>Fox News' Connor Hansen and Charles Creitz contributed to this report.</i></p>
