"Once it gets a little bit dicey, they pack up and go home and say, ‘Everything we saw was nice and peaceful.’"</p><p>Sortor said he refused to stop filming despite rising tensions, insisting he would not be intimidated into leaving.</p><p>However, the situation escalated when protesters allegedly tried to force him out of the area through violence.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/street-takeovers-traffic-control-agitators-minnesota-cross-legal-lines-retired-nypd-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STREET TAKEOVERS AND TRAFFIC CONTROL BY AGITATORS IN MINNESOTA CROSS LEGAL LINES, RETIRED DETECTIVE SAYS</strong></a></p><p>"They decided that they were going to try to brutally assault me to get me to leave, which included throwing frozen water bottles, which are essentially bricks."</p><p>"This is an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/antifa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antifa tactic</a>, where they pre-position them, and they intend to use them against people like me, as well as federal agents, because in the past they have a history of doing brain damage to people that they throw these things at, so that's exactly what they did."</p><p>Sortor said he and his team refused to leave or turn off their cameras, even as the situation grew more dangerous.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minneapolis-area-leaders-condemn-ice-call-removal-trump-deportation-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNEAPOLIS-AREA LEADERS CONDEMN ICE, CALL FOR REMOVAL AMID TRUMP DEPORTATION CAMPAIGN</strong></a></p><p>He can be heard requesting help and notifying a dispatcher that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-ice-agitators-swarm-vehicle-conservative-influencer-nick-sortor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agitators had blocked his car</a> and "threatened to kill" him in a tense 911 call played during the broadcast.</p><p>"Our vehicle is surrounded. We need help now," Sortor said in the call. </p><p>Sortor said in a video posted on X that his car windows were smashed, and he was forced to drive away from the scene as protesters surrounded him.</p><p>In another video posted to social media, Sortor shows his truck’s rear window bearing white spray-painted graffiti and takes frozen water bottles out of the bed of his truck.</p><p>He added that he and fellow influencer Cam Higby were safe despite being threatened during the encounter, and thanked officers with the Eagan Police Department for their help.</p><p>"It's terrifying. It's terrifying to be a conservative in Minneapolis right now," he said. "And that's exactly how Tim Walz and the mayor out here want it to be."</p><p><i>Fox News' Ashley Carnahan contributed to this report.</i></p>
