But before we start this episode, I just want to send much love to the best people in the world, also known as Minnesotans. What we are all witnessing is terrifying and enraging and illegal. But we are also seeing neighbors helping neighbors. And if you want to help, there is a directory of local organizations and mutual aid groups that you can check out at standwithmininnesota.com. Minnesota, you're in our hearts."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> confirmed three federal investigations into the fatal shooting of Pretti are underway.</p><p>During a briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI were investigating the shooting and U.S. Customs and Border Protection was "conducting their own internal review."</p><p>Many celebrities have been speaking out online in the wake of Pretti's death.</p><p>In a lengthy Instagram post, supermodel Bella Hadid called for the abolition of ICE, strongly criticizing their aggressive tactics.</p><p>"Abolish ICE.
