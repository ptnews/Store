<p>Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lindsey-graham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lindsey Graham</a> announced Wednesday that President Donald Trump has approved a Russian sanctions bill designed to pressure Moscow to end its war with Ukraine.</p><p>Graham revealed the development in a post on X, describing it as a pivotal shift in the U.S. approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. </p><p>"After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia sanctions bill</a> that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others," Graham said. </p><p>"This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-touts-tremendous-progress-says-hell-meet-putin-zelenskyy-only-when-peace-deal-final" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP TOUTS 'TREMENDOUS PROGRESS' BUT SAYS HE'LL MEET PUTIN AND ZELENSKYY 'ONLY WHEN' PEACE DEAL IS FINAL</strong></a></p><p>According to the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, the bipartisan legislation is designed to grant Trump sweeping, almost unprecedented, authority to economically isolate Russia and penalize major global economies that continue to trade with Moscow and finance its war against Ukraine.</p><p>Most notably, the bill would require the United States to impose a 500% tariff on all goods imported from any country that continues to purchase Russian oil, petroleum products or uranium. The measure would effectively squeeze Russia financially while deterring foreign governments from undermining U.S. sanctions.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-casts-maduros-ouster-smart-move-russia-china-enter-fray" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP CASTS MADURO’S OUSTER AS ‘SMART’ MOVE AS RUSSIA, CHINA ENTER THE FRAY</strong></a></p><p>"This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin’s war machine</a>," Graham said.</p><p>"This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countries like China</a>, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine."</p><p>Graham said voting could take place as early as next week and that he is looking forward to a strong bipartisan vote.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-forces-attempting-board-sanctioned-russian-flagged-oil-tanker-north-atlantic-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US MILITARY SEIZES TWO SANCTIONED TANKERS IN ATLANTIC OCEAN</strong></a></p><p>The move on the Russian sanctions bill follows another sharp escalation in America’s clampdown on Moscow. Earlier Wednesday, U.S. forces reportedly seized an oil tanker attempting to transport sanctioned Venezuelan oil to Russia.</p><p>Graham publicly celebrated the seizure in another post on X, describing it as part of a broader winning streak of U.S. intervention aimed at Venezuela and Cuba. </p><p>In the post, he also took aim at critics such as Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/rand-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rand Paul</a>, who has opposed the bill, arguing that it would damage America’s trade relations with much of the world.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.</p>
