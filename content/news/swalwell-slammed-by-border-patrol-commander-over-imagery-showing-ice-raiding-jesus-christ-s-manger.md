<p>The architect of some of DHS’ most consequential immigration enforcement operations fired back at Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., after Swalwell posted a Christmas image depicting a <a href="https://x.com/RepSwalwell/status/2004193505573589339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helicopter and ICE agents</a> converging on the Bethlehem crèche.</p><p>"May this be the last Christmas we live this nightmare," Swalwell captioned the image, which drew widespread backlash during the Twelve Days of Christmas.</p><p>"Yes, the last Christmas where un-American pedantic dolts choose illegal aliens over US Citizens," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino</a> responded, before following up by exchanging with others on social media.</p><p>Bovino then replied to a Florida woman who told Swalwell: "Yes, the nightmare was [the] last four years prior letting in everyone and their grandma. Insane [a] congressman would post this."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-catholic-bishops-chided-sowing-confusion-deportations-stance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EXCLUSIVE: CATHOLIC BISHOPS CHIDED FOR SOWING ‘CONFUSION’ ON DEPORTATIONS STANCE</strong></a></p><p>"Well said… Merry Christmas," Bovino said, adding he would follow her X account.</p><p>When another critic brought up <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swalwell’s alleged relationship</a> with a Chinese spy named Fang Fang — which the congressman denies – Bovino quipped, "Oh yes, how could I forget to mention that."</p><p>Other commentators slammed Swalwell for appearing to misstate the underlying facts of why <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joseph and Mary</a> had gone to Bethlehem and why they fled to Egypt soon after Jesus Christ’s birth — a storyline immigration activists sometimes use to counter pro-border security arguments.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-fires-back-dem-lawmaker-claims-she-pushed-aside-pepper-sprayed-during-ice-raid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DHS FIRES BACK AFTER DEM LAWMAKER CLAIMS SHE WAS 'PUSHED ASIDE AND PEPPER SPRAYED' DURING ICE RAID</strong></a></p><p>One cited a passage from the Gospel of Luke, which recounts that Caesar Augustus ordered a census across the Roman Empire, requiring each man to return to his ancestral town.

Lying about this is Christophobic," he said. </p><p>Starbuck added that in the Book of Acts, God "marked out … boundaries of their lands," which the commentator said was proof that secure borders have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scriptural grounding</a>.</p><p>Another critic posted an image of actor Gerry Bamman as his "Uncle Frank" character sneering in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/christmas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christmas classic</a> "Home Alone," as if to reply to the congressman's depiction.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Swalwell for comment for purposes of this story but did not hear back by press time.</p>
