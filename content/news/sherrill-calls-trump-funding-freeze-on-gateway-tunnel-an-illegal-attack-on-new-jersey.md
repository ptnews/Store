<p>Recently sworn-in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey</a> Gov. Mikie Sherrill has called on President Donald Trump to immediately restore funding for the $16 billion Gateway Tunnel project, a major rail infrastructure effort under the Hudson River that will link New Jersey to New York City.</p><p>Sherrill, a Democrat, said that the president’s refusal to fund the Gateway Tunnel project is an "illegal attack on New Jersey" that also shows a "reckless disregard" for the state’s economy and the livelihoods of working families.</p><p>"If the president does not restore funding to this project, which I helped secure while serving in Congress, he will single-handedly kill nearly 100,000 jobs and $20 billion in economic activity," Sherrill said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/duffy-says-times-up-newsom-feds-withhold-160m-over-illegal-trucking-licenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DUFFY SAYS ‘TIME’S UP’ FOR NEWSOM AS FEDS WITHHOLD $160M OVER ILLEGAL TRUCKING LICENSES</strong></a></p><p>"New Jersey will fight tooth and nail for our hard-earned tax dollars and this essential project that will make commutes easier and improve quality of life for residents in the Garden State," she added.</p><p>Sherrill said that New Jersey and New York make up the most powerful economic region in the world and called the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/infrastructure-across-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gateway Project</a> the most urgent and consequential infrastructure project in the country.</p><p>The Trump administration, hours into a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/federal-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal government</a> shutdown in the fall, announced the freezing of billions of dollars in federal funding for the tunnel, as well as for the extension of New York City’s Second Avenue Subway.</p><p>Trump then terminated the funding, blaming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for being responsible for the shutdown. Trump noted that Schumer had spent years trying to get the project built.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rips-congestion-pricing-calls-immediate-end-a-disaster-new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP RIPS CONGESTION PRICING, CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE END: 'A DISASTER FOR NEW YORK'</strong></a></p><p>The project has been under construction for more than a year after it received pledges of about $12 billion from the federal government.</p><p>The Department of Transportation said funding would remain suspended pending a review of contracts for compliance with new rules governing women and minority-owned businesses, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/nyregion/hudson-tunnel-gateway-funding.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The New York Times</a>.</p><p>About 1,000 union workers are currently still on the job at four sites in New York City and New Jersey, and it's being kept alive temporarily by a line of credit, which is expected to run out Feb. 6, per the outlet.</p><p>A White House spokesperson pushed back on Sherrill's comments, blaming Democrats for the impasse.</p><p>"It’s Chuck Schumer and Democrats who are standing in the way of a deal for the Gateway Tunnel Project by refusing to negotiate with the Trump administration," White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital in a statement. </p><p>"There is nothing stopping Democrats from prioritizing the interests of Americans over illegal aliens and getting this project back on track," Desai added.</p><p>The project is considered necessary because the existing Hudson River rail tunnels are 115 years old and were badly damaged by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/floods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saltwater flooding</a> during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. They carry about 70,000 New Jersey commuters daily and Amtrak has warned that failure of one tunnel could cut <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters/transportation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rail traffic</a> into New York City by up to 75%.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., echoed Sherrill’s demands, calling the continued withholding of federal funds "inexcusable" and urging the administration to immediately release the money.</p><p>"These actions put union workers and families across New York and New Jersey at risk and threaten the most critical infrastructure project in the nation," Gillibrand said.</p><p>"New Yorkers will not be treated as political pawns in this administration’s twisted game of chess," she added.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also blasted the funding freeze, calling it "the latest collateral damage" of what she described as Trump’s vindictive effort to harm New Yorkers.</p><p>"Make no mistake, the Gateway Tunnel is vital to the economy of this state and the entire region, and I will fight like hell to ensure it gets built," Hochul said.</p>
