According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), agents were attempting to make arrests when Good tried to use her vehicle as a weapon against officers, prompting a federal agent to fire in self-defense.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-look-defunding-ice-impeaching-sec-noem-after-minneapolis-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEMOCRATS LOOK AT DEFUNDING ICE, IMPEACHING NOEM AFTER MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING</strong></a></p><p>Hours after the shooting, Frey spoke at a press conference, where he told ICE to leave the city and called the DHS statement that the shooting happened in self-defense "garbage."</p><p>Kimmel played a clip from the mayor’s address that ended with Frey’s message to ICE, prompting thunderous applause and cheers from the audience.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/walz-prepares-national-guard-woman-killed-ice-operation-never-been-war-federal-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WALZ PREPARES NATIONAL GUARD AFTER WOMAN KILLED IN ICE OPERATION: 'NEVER BEEN AT WAR' WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</strong></a></p><p>Holding the shirt, Kimmel said, "To ICE, get the f--- out of Minneapolis.

It didn’t look anybody got run over to me," he told the audience. "It looked to me like a woman got scared, tried to drive away, and they shot her. That’ll be for the court to decide."</p><p>During a press conference on Thursday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said that Good was "using a vehicle to try to kill an officer and his colleagues," and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-alleges-woman-killed-ice-shooting-stalking-impeding-agents-all-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called her actions</a> an "act of domestic terrorism."</p><p><i>Fox News' Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.</i></p>
