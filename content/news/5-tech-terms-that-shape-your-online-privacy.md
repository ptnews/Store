Some permissions are necessary for an app to function, but many apps ask for far more access than they actually need.</p><p>Once granted, these permissions can <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allow apps to collect data in the background</a>, sometimes even when you're not actively using them. Over time, this can quietly expose sensitive personal information.</p><p>Regularly reviewing and limiting app permissions in your phone's settings is one of the easiest and most effective ways to improve your privacy. Pay special attention to apps with access to your location, microphone and photo library.</p><p><strong>To review permissions by category</strong></p><p><strong>To review permissions by app</strong></p><p><strong>Extra privacy tip</strong></p><p>S<i>ettings may vary depending on your Android phone’s manufacturer</i></p><p><strong>To review permissions by category</strong></p><p><strong>To review permissions by app</strong></p><p><strong>Extra privacy tip</strong></p><p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p><p><strong>Extra protection beyond settings:</strong></p><p>Even with careful permission management, malicious apps and phishing attempts can still slip through. A trusted antivirus solution helps block malware, fake pop-ups and dangerous downloads before they compromise your device. </p><p>Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/malicious-chrome-extensions-caught-stealing-sensitive-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA</u></strong></a></p><p><i><strong>When your phone knows where you are, constantly</strong></i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/smartphones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Location services use GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth</a>, and nearby cell towers to determine your location. While this is helpful for maps and weather, many apps request constant access they don't actually need.</p><p>Reducing location access limits, tracking and helps protect your daily routines.</p><p><strong>To review all location access</strong></p><p><strong>For each app</strong></p><p>S<i>ettings may vary depending on your Android phone’s manufacturer</i></p><p><strong>To review location access</strong></p><p><strong>For each app</strong></p><p><strong>Recommended settings</strong></p><p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p><p><i><strong>Your second line of defense</strong></i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/what-two-factor-authentication-should-enable-it" rel="nofollow"><u>Two-factor authentication (2FA)</u></a> adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have, like a one-time code sent to your phone or generated by an app.</p><p>Even if hackers steal your password through a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/university-phoenix-data-breach-hits-3-5m-people" rel="nofollow"><u>data breach</u></a> or <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/dont-click-that-link-how-to-spot-prevent-phishing-attacks-in-your-inbox" rel="nofollow"><u>phishing attack</u></a>, 2FA can stop them from accessing your accounts. That's why security experts strongly recommend enabling it on email, banking, cloud storage and social media accounts.</p><p>It may take a few extra seconds to log in, but 2FA can prevent identity theft and unauthorized access, making it one of the most powerful security tools available.</p><p><strong>Extra security tip:</strong><br>Strong passwords and two-factor authentication work best together. If remembering complex passwords or managing one-time codes feels overwhelming, a secure password manager can generate, store and autofill strong passwords safely.</p><p>Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/hackers-abuse-google-cloud-send-trusted-phishing-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS</strong></a></p><p><i><strong>Hiding your online activity</strong></i></p><p>A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your online activity from outsiders.</p><p>VPNs are especially important when using <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/cybercrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels or coffee shops,</a> where cybercriminals can intercept unprotected data. They also help limit tracking by advertisers and internet service providers.</p><p>While a VPN doesn't make you completely anonymous online, it adds a valuable layer of privacy and security, especially when browsing, shopping or accessing sensitive accounts.</p><p>For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your <strong>Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices</strong> at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><i><strong>How companies follow you across apps</strong></i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/smart-and-safe-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cross-app tracking</a> lets advertisers and data brokers link your activity across multiple apps and websites. That data is used to build detailed profiles based on what you do, buy and watch.</p><p>On <strong>iPhone</strong>, this tracking is controlled by Apple's App Tracking Transparency system.<br>On <strong>Android</strong>, it relies on advertising IDs and ad personalization controls.</p><p>Turning these off limits how easily companies can connect your behavior across apps. You'll still see ads, but they won't be tailored to your personal activity.</p><p><strong>Optional extra protection</strong></p><p>S<i>ettings may vary depending on your Android phone’s manufacturer</i></p><p><strong>What this does</strong></p><p><strong>One more thing to know:</strong><br>Turning off cross-app tracking helps going forward, but it doesn’t remove data that’s already been collected.
