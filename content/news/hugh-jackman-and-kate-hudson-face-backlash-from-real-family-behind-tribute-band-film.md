The documentary was released two years after his father's death in July 2006 after he suffered a brain bleed following a fall.</p><p>Text messages obtained by the Daily Mail, between Mike Jr.'s sister, Angelina, and the film's producer, John Fox, confirm the two were paid $30,000 to consult, and also showed sympathy on Fox's part, as he told Angelina "I totally understand, and I'm sorry, know it's not the most ideal situation," regarding their lack of input.</p><p>Angelina is included in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the movie</a>, portrayed by King Princess, with the Daily Mail reporting she signed a contract in which she authorized the movie to tell a fictionalized version of her story, but did not ensure she would be in contact with anyone from the cast, including King Princess.</p><p>The two also had issues with the way their father was portrayed, with Mike Jr. saying that if anyone had spoken to them about their father, they would have known that he "would speak in a very, very slow kind of way."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hugh-jackman-sutton-foster-make-romance-red-carpet-official-months-after-actors-divorce-from-longtime-wife" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HUGH JACKMAN, SUTTON FOSTER MAKE ROMANCE RED CARPET OFFICIAL MONTHS AFTER ACTOR'S DIVORCE FROM LONGTIME WIFE</strong></a></p><p>"[My father] would thank God every single show, and then he would go on a very short testimony about his journey through recovery," he recalled. "And if anybody felt like they were alone or maybe they needed help or they needed prayer, [he would tell them], "'You come up here after the show and I will sit here and I'll talk to you'."</p><p>In addition to having no input in the story, Mike Jr. and Angelina say the movie didn't do a good job of showing the tension that existed in their home as they were growing up, with Angelina saying, "The only thing that was true is the love between my dad and Claire."</p><p>"I mean, yes, it's a great story," she said. "It's a beautiful story, but that's not how it went down. And I guess that's what's upsetting because it's a lie."</p><p>While Mike Jr. and Angelina are upset with the end product, their stepmother Claire, who married Mike Sr. at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin State Fair</a> in 1994, and her two kids from a prior marriage — son Dayna and daughter Rachel — have been very supportive.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>The three happily posed with Jackman and Hudson at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-hudson-wows-plunging-gown-song-sung-blue-nyc-premiere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City premiere</a> in early December, with both Carol and Rachel joining Jackman on stage to sing on separate occasions.</p><p>Mike Jr. and Angelina were also invited to the premiere, but according to Mike Jr., they were told to "keep away from any of the stars and reporters."</p><p>"I want the true story out there and I want it used with truth, with dignity, and I want retribution," Mike Jr. said. "I want retribution from NBCUniversal [and other parties involved], not just for me, for my father, for me, and for my little sister - my father's true descendants because they screwed us over."</p><p>"Everybody thinks it's such a wonderful film, it's so touching," he added. "It's all lies. And it steals all the hard work that my father put in his entire life so that Claire, Rachel, and Dayna can soak up a massive paycheck."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
