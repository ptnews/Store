Meanwhile, we’re out here actually making a difference for girls. We are not the same," Wheeler wrote, later joking, "'A lifetime wasted trying to succeed in sports without talent' directed at an SEC Champion &amp; multi-time All-American from a man FIRED from nearly EVERY network he’s touched lol… you would know a thing or two about a wasted life." </p><p>Several prominent female athletes women's sports activists defended Wheeler on social media against Olbermann. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/serena-williams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women's tennis legend</a> Martina Navratilova told Olbermann she was unfollowing him on X over the remark.</p><p>"Seriously?

What a miserable existence. I don’t envy you, but I do pray for you," Gaines wrote.</p><p>Former Team USA women's ultrarunner Carilyn Johson suggested Olbermann is "mentally ill."</p><p>"I used to think Keith Olbermann was just a misogynist.
