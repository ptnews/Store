<p>The Pennsylvania affiliate of the Working Families Party said it launched a new website as part of its campaign to primary Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/john-fetterman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Fetterman, D-Pa.,</a> and "defeat him." </p><p>"We supported John Fetterman in 2022. Since then, he's sold us out. It's time to replace him," reads a message on the homepage of PrimaryFetterman.com, which was paid for by the Working Families Party PAC. </p><p>"He has supported more of Trump's nominees than any Democratic Senator. He consistently skips votes and Senate work. We deserve better," the website adds. </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Fetterman’s office for comment. The effort to primary him <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRM8mT3Dm8r/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>was announced last November,</u></a> and at the time, <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2025/11/21/john-fetterman-taunts-working-families-party-primary-threat/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Fetterman told Fox News,</u></a> "I guarantee whoever they put up, they’re going to make me look the reasonable guy that’s going to work with both sides together and find a way for Pennsylvania."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-john-fetterman-calls-democrats-resist-advocacy-extreme-stances-like-abolishing-ice" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN CALLS FOR DEMOCRATS TO ‘RESIST’ ADVOCACY OF ‘EXTREME’ STANCES LIKE ABOLISHING ICE</strong></a></p><p>Fetterman was elected to the Senate in 2022. He isn’t up for re-election until November 2028.  </p><p>When PA Working Families launched their effort to primary him, they said in a post on X, "We're training potential candidates, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/campaigning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting volunteers</a>, and soliciting donations to help us defeat him." </p><p>"If you previously donated to any of Fetterman's campaigns, you can request a refund of your contributions on the site in just a few clicks," it added Friday in a post about PrimaryFetterman.com.</p><p>On its website, the Working Families Party describes itself as, "a multiracial party that fights for workers over bosses and people over the powerful."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-breaks-democrats-back-trumps-iran-military-threats-amid-regime-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FETTERMAN BREAKS WITH DEMOCRATS TO BACK TRUMP TAKING MILITARY ACTION IN IRAN IF NECESSARY</strong></a></p><p>While some Democrats advocate for the abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Fetterman pressed his party this week not to advocate for "extreme" ideas. </p><p>"Even Mayor Frey of Minneapolis doesn’t support abolishing ICE. The party must resist the destructive tendencies to push extreme positions," Fetterman noted Thursday in a post on X.  </p><p>"Secure the border. Deport all the criminals. Stop targeting the hardworking migrants in our nation," he added. </p><p>Fetterman also said Monday that he would surely support President Donald Trump taking military action in Iran if it was deemed necessary.</p><p>"Sure, absolutely," he said on CNN. "If it continues to make more sense, absolutely. I think I was the only Democrat that fully supported our strike of their Iranian nuclear facilities last year." </p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Alex Nitzberg and Alba Cuebas-Fantauzzi contributed to this report.</i> </p>
