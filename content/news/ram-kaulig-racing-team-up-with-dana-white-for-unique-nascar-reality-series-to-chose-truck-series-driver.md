"This reality show is all about finding up-and-coming drivers and giving them a massive platform. The best always rise to the top in this type of competition. We are going to find the next generation of superstars for the NASCAR truck series."</p><p>White knows a thing or two about competition reality series, with UFC’s "The Ultimate Fighter" being a massive hit in the mixed martial arts world.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/kaulig-racing-ram-unveil-unique-free-agent-program-2026-nascar-truck-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KAULIG RACING, RAM UNVEIL UNIQUE FREE AGENT PROGRAM FOR 2026 NASCAR TRUCK SERIES</strong></a></p><p>And just like that show, White, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/make/ram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ram CEO</a> Tim Kuniskis and Kaulig Racing Team Owner Matt Kaulig will be as unfiltered as possible with their behind-the-scenes commentary. It will be a true look into what it takes for a driver to make a team, as well as the ownership perspective of what to look for in the perfect driver.</p><p>"'Race For The Seat' is a great opportunity for the next generation of drivers to show what they’ve got," Kaulig said in a statement. "Working with Ram to bring this show to life allows us to think differently, push the limits, and give these talented drivers a platform they wouldn’t normally have. I can’t wait to see who earns the seat and joins us on the track."</p><p>Kuniskis added: "We promised Ram would approach NASCAR differently — and ‘Race For The Seat’ is proof.
