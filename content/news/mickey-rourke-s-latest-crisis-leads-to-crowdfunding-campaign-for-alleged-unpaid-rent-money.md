<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mickey-rourke-accused-homophobic-jojo-siwa-comments-hit-warning-reality-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mickey Rourke's career</a> has been defined by extremes, including self-imposed detours, legal drama, comebacks and recurring controversy. </p><p>Now, Rourke has found himself in legal trouble again. He was recently served an eviction notice after allegedly falling behind on nearly $60,000 in rent on his Los Angeles home. A member of Rourke's management team seemingly launched a GoFundMe to help the action film star raise the money to stay in his home. The fundraiser had over $70,000 in donations after 24 hours. Rourke later denied he was involved in setting up the fundraiser and urged fans not to donate.</p><p>"Something’s come up that I’m really frustrated, confused, and I don’t understand," Roruke said in a video shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTJyL1VkZs1/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">on Instagram</a>. "Somebody set up some kind of foundation or fund for me to donate money, like charity. And that’s not me, OK? If I needed money, I wouldn’t ask for no f---ing charity. I’d rather stick a gun up my a-- and pull the trigger."</p><p>He added: "Whoever did this … I don’t know why they did it. I don’t understand it. I wouldn’t know what a GoFund foundation is in a million years. My life is very simple. I don’t go to outside sources like that. Yeah, it is embarrassing, but I’m sure I’ll get over it like everything else."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mickey-rourke-blacklisted-hollywood-catholic-faith" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MICKEY ROURKE RECALLS BEING BLACKLISTED IN HOLLYWOOD, HOW A PRIEST ‘SAVED’ HIM: ‘YOU’VE GOTTA BE TOUGH’</strong></a></p><p>Here's a look back at Mickey Rourke's tumultuous career:</p><p>After seeing success in the film industry with "Body Heat," "Diner," "9 ½ Weeks" and "Angel Heart," Mickey Rourke chose to take his talent a different route.</p><p>Rourke became a professional boxer in 1991.</p><p>The famed actor fought in the ring from 1991 until he chose to retire in 1994. He opened up about the injuries he suffered while boxing in a 2009 interview with the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1150506/Mickey-Rourke-Ive-hacked-people-Hollywood-hell-Oscar.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>"I had my nose broken twice. I had five operations on my nose and one on a smashed cheekbone," he recalled. "I had to have cartilage taken from my ear to rebuild my nose and a couple of operations to scrape out the cartilage because the scar tissue wasn't healing properly."</p><p>He claimed most of his cosmetic operations were "to mend the mess of my face because of the boxing, but I went to the wrong guy to put my face back together."</p><p>Rourke was arrested in 1994 after he allegedly slapped his then-wife, knocked her down and kicked her during a visit to the couple's publicist's office.</p><p>Rourke later pleaded not guilty before the charges were dropped after Carre Otis failed to appear in court multiple times.</p><p>Otis later wrote about the passion she experienced while dating Rourke.</p><p>"Already in those early days, my craving for him was at its strongest when we weren’t together," she wrote in <a href="https://nypost.com/2011/10/09/mickey-the-model/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">her memoir</a>, "Beauty, Disrupted." "We’d be separated for a few hours, and I could think of nothing else but being with him again. We both loved the drama of it all, loved the fantasy of being head over heels in love, unable to be apart. When people ask why I would end up staying with him for so long, this is a huge part of the answer. The times we weren’t together were the times I wanted him most."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

"They don’t care about what they hear. They judge me by my acting ability, not my old reputation. So it’s been sort of a resurrection of being able to work with younger directors. I have a love/hate relationship with acting. I enjoy what I’m doing at the moment because I can give everything that I’m taught. I have my confidence. I went through the s--- that I went through, so I’m able to use it in my performances. I could be standing across from any f---ing actor.

"In the late 1970s and 1980s, he wasn’t just a movie star; he was a symbol of something rare: danger paired with vulnerability, toughness paired with heart. From Diner to Rumble Fish to 9½ Weeks, Mickey gave audiences performances that felt lived-in, not performed, and left a permanent mark on American film culture. </p><p>"Mickey’s life never followed a safe or protected path. At the height of his success, he stepped away from Hollywood in search of truth and authenticity, choosing risk over comfort. Boxing—real and punishing—left lasting physical and emotional scars, and the industry that once celebrated him moved on quickly," it continued. "What followed were years of struggle not defined by spectacle, but by survival: health challenges, financial strain, and the quiet toll of being left behind."</p><p>"Today, Mickey is facing a very real and urgent situation: the threat of eviction from his home. This fundraiser is being created with Mickey’s full permission to help cover immediate housing-related expenses and prevent that from happening. Mickey Rourke is an icon—but his trajectory, as painful as it is, is also a deeply human one. It is the story of someone who gave everything to his work, took real risks, and paid real costs."</p>
