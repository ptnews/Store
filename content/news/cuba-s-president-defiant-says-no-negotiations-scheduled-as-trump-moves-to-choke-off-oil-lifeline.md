<p>Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel declared Monday that his administration is not negotiating with Washington, despite President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>’s threats to push Cuba into a deal now that Venezuelan oil will no longer be supplied.</p><p>"There are no conversations with the U.S. government, except for technical contacts in the migration field," Díaz-Canel said in a post on X.</p><p>Díaz-Canel continued to denounce the U.S., accusing it of applying hostile pressure on the island, and insisted that negotiations would only take place if they are conducted in accordance with international law.</p><p>"As history demonstrates, relations between the U.S. and Cuba, in order to advance, must be based on International Law rather than on hostility, threats, and economic coercion," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-control-venezuelan-oil-sales-radical-shift-aimed-restarting-crude-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ADMIN TO CONTROL VENEZUELAN OIL SALES IN RADICAL SHIFT AIMED AT RESTARTING CRUDE FLOW</strong></a></p><p>"We have always been willing to engage in a serious and responsible dialogue with the various governments of the United States, including the current one, on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect, principles of International Law, reciprocal benefit without interference in internal affairs and with full respect for our independence," Canel added. </p><p>On Sunday, Trump declared that Cuba would no longer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ultimatum-cuba-make-deal-before-too-late-face-consequences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive oil or money</a> from Venezuela, a move that would sever Havana’s longtime energy and financial lifeline. </p><p>The announcement came after a stunning Jan. 3 operation in Venezuela, in which American forces captured President Nicolás Maduro and reportedly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/cuba-identifies-32-military-personnel-killed-us-operation-maduro-regime-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed at least 32 Cuban personnel</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/venezuelan-oil-shipments-surge-us-ports-heavy-crude-maduro-capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VENEZUELAN OIL SHIPMENTS SURGE TO US PORTS WITH HEAVY CRUDE AFTER MADURO CAPTURE</strong></a></p><p>"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE," he warned.</p><p>Cuba has long depended on imported oil to keep its aging power grid running. Before the U.S. attack on Venezuela, Havana was receiving 35,000 barrels a day from Venezuela, roughly 7,500 from Russia and some 5,500 barrels daily from Mexico, The Associated Press reported, citing Jorge Piñón of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, who tracks the shipments.</p><p>Even with Venezuelan oil imports, Cuba has suffered widespread blackouts in recent years due to persistent fuel shortages, an aging and crumbling electric grid and damage from hurricanes that have battered the island’s infrastructure.  </p><p>Now, with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. sanctions</a> tightening on both Russian and Venezuelan oil, blackouts could worsen as Havana’s leaders reject Trump’s call to strike a deal. </p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
