"It’s got to be ended, IMMEDIATELY! It’s never worked before, and it will never work now. I love New York, and hate to see it being destroyed so rapidly with such obviously foolish "policy." Thank you for your attention to this matter!"</p><p>New York began congestion pricing in January 2025. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-wild-mamdani-flip-insults-came-before-love-fest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP’S WILD MAMDANI FLIP — THE INSULTS THAT CAME BEFORE THE LOVE FEST</u></strong></a></p><p>The program uses electronic license plate readers and charges <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most drivers</a> a $9 toll during peak periods to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street in an attempt to reduce congestion and raise funds to improve mass transit.</p><p>Months after it began, the city said it reduced traffic in the impacted areas by 8% to 13%. </p><p>Trump has long voiced criticism of the congestion pricing program. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-city-urges-judge-block-trump-administration-eliminating-congestion-pricing-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NEW YORK CITY URGES JUDGE TO BLOCK TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM ELIMINATING ITS CONGESTION PRICING PROGRAM</u></strong></a></p><p>He tried and failed to end it, and threatened to withhold federal funds from the city if officials didn't kill it. </p><p>On Jan. 5, the one-year anniversary of the program. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul touted it as successful. </p><p>"The opposition’s kind of calmed down, right?" Hochul said at a press conference.
