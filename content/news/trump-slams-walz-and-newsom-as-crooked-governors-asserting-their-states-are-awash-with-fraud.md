When you add in Election Fraud, then they are tied for first. Two Crooked Governors, two Crooked States!" the president asserted in the <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115814835032750025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> on Wednesday, referring to California Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gavin-newsom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gavin Newsom</a> and Minnesota Gov.

Did she really marry her brother? Lowlifes like this can only be a liability to our Country’s greatness. Send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth.
