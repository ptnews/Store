<p><strong>FIRST ON FOX:</strong> The Department of Homeland Security says it arrested a man in Minneapolis Wednesday night who assaulted a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal immigration agent</a> while carrying a gun and box of ammunition.</p><p>The incident occurred several hours after DHS says a separate agent was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-agent-shoots-venezuelan-national-minneapolis-shovel-attack-ambush-dhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked by an illegal migrant</a> from Venezuela with a shovel. The illegal migrant was shot in the leg, prompting riots to escalate in the city shortly after. </p><p>"Last night during a riot in Minneapolis, a U.S. citizen was arrested for assaulting officers while carrying a firearm," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"The individual showed up to the protest with a gun and a box of ammunition in a bag. The individual threatened violence against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law enforcement officers</a> while pointing at his bag.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-drug-czar-rips-democrats-over-anti-ice-rhetoric-putting-everybodys-life-danger" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP DRUG CZAR RIPS DEMOCRATS OVER ANTI-ICE RHETORIC PUTTING 'EVERYBODY'S LIFE IN DANGER'</strong></a></p><p>"After law enforcement deployed crowd control measures to calm an increasingly volatile crowd, the individual kicked a metal smoke canister at officers. He then pushed an officer, and he was arrested for assault," McLaughlin explained. </p><p>"While being arrested, he stated he had a firearm, which was located along with a box of ammunition. He was not carrying his concealed carry permit. This is not the peaceful protesting that the First Amendment protects." </p><p>Tensions in Minneapolis have been high as days of riots ravage the city and federal law enforcement officers face off with agitators. </p><p>Riots began shortly after 37-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/omar-dems-demand-noem-impeachment-paint-minnesota-woman-shot-ice-poet-chose-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renee Nicole Good was killed</a> by an ICE agent during an altercation in Minneapolis last week.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ice-head-says-agents-facing-constant-impediments-after-migrant-seen-ramming-cars-while-trying-flee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE HEAD SAYS AGENTS FACING 'CONSTANT IMPEDIMENTS' AFTER MIGRANT SEEN RAMMING CARS WHILE TRYING TO FLEE</strong></a></p><p>Homeland Security Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristi-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Noem</a> referred to the Good as a "domestic terrorist," alleging she used her vehicle as a weapon after obstructing ICE agents on the roadway.</p><p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE to "get the f--- out of Minneapolis" during a news conference after Good’s death, and Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> criticized DHS, posting to X that he saw the video, and referred to Noem’s explanation of the incident as a part of a "propaganda machine."</p><p>On Thursday, President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatens-invoke-insurrection-act-minnesota-agitators-keep-attacking-federal-officers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act</a> if people in Minnesota continue to disobey the law and endanger federal officers.</p><p>"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INSURRECTION ACT</a>, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State," Trump posted to TRUTH Social. </p><p>Should President Trump invoke the legislation signed into law in 1807, he would be allowed to send National Guardsmen into the area to stabilize control and reduce violence.</p>
