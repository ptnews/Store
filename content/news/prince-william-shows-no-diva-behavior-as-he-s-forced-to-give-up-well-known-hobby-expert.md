<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/will" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prince William</a> will have to find a new hobby.</p><p>The king-in-waiting's recent move to Forest Lodge has forced the royal to give up his electric scooter. Prince William's new home is inside <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/british-royals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windsor Great Park</a>, where various forms of motorized transportation are banned.</p><p>"For reasons of safety and traffic management, we do not allow motorised transport within the Park," the park's website stated. "Aside from cyclists, the roads are reserved for residents and Estate workers."</p><p>Royal experts predict Prince William will adhere to the e-scooter ban with ease, highlighting his anti-diva behavior. The 43-year-old prince was known for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@angela_xue/video/7387939184310258986" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">riding an e-scooter</a> around Windsor Castle.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-middletons-hidden-hobby-love-outdoors-fuels-rural-renaissance-rising-popularity-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KATE MIDDLETON’S HIDDEN HOBBY, LOVE FOR THE OUTDOORS FUELS HER ‘RURAL RENAISSANCE’ AND RISING POPULARITY: EXPERT</strong></a></p><p>"Prince William will miss the convenience and his fun, but he’s self‑disciplined, always adhering to rules and abiding even with humor," British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital. "He always manages to underscore the appropriate behavior of those in a constitutional monarchy rather than being a diva, untouchable celebrity royalty."</p><p>"So, he’ll accept such limits, albeit there are some residents who use e-scooters on lanes closest to their homes but not on high profile areas like the Long Walk," she added. "If he uses one it would be discreet as guidance allows. Even the future king can’t ride a low‑speed scooter on roads of an estate which is nominally ‘his’ family’s, due to park authority prioritizing risk management optics."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-philip-gave-kate-middleton-blunt-warning-surviving-royal-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PRINCE PHILIP GAVE KATE MIDDLETON BLUNT WARNING ABOUT SURVIVING ROYAL LIFE</u></strong></a></p><p>Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner hopes this turn of events will encourage people to wear safety gear, as Prince William often chose not to wear a helmet.</p><p>"The sight of Prince William using his electric scooter at speed around the grounds of Windsor Castle, in my opinion, should have been banned some time ago, especially as on many occasions he has not been seen wearing a safety helmet," he told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"The guidance normally is that a safety helmet and other protective body gear similar to skateboarders' is essential to protect the man waiting to become King."</p><p>"If he fell off, then he could cause himself serious injury and also not putting out the proper safety measures for other scooter users. Thus, perhaps if this action becomes a reality, it is both a safety code for other users and an accident prevention method for the Prince."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
