<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/syria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syrian army</a>’s rapid-fire conquest of important areas and towns previously controlled by the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), culminated on Sunday in a fragile ceasefire agreement with a stern warning from a powerful U.S. Senator and experts about the reported crimes of forces controlled by President Ahmed al-Sharaa.</p><p>Jim Risch, R-Idaho., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Fox News Digital, "The Syrian government’s decree to respect Kurdish rights is a good sign, but the conduct of its forces on the ground must match. Division and violence in Syria between U.S. partners only benefit bad actors like ISIS and Iran who exploit Syria to use as a breeding ground for international terrorism, including against the U.S. I welcome the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/republican-senator-condemns-alleged-syrian-army-abuses-ceasefire-follows-aleppo-fighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of a ceasefire</a> and will be watching its implementation closely."</p><p>Al-Sharaa, a former U.S.-designated terrorist who was a member of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-says-syria-using-force-option-against-us-backed-fighters-who-helped-defeat-isis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greenlighted an incursion into territory</a> ruled peacefully by the SDF for over a decade.</p><p>Amid Risch's warning, reports coming out of Syria claim skirmishes between the Syrian army and SDF are continuing. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/130-house-republicans-demand-assurances-before-us-eases-syria-sanctions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>134 HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEMAND 'ASSURANCES' BEFORE US EASES SYRIA SANCTIONS</strong></a></p><p>The news organization, <a href="https://x.com/k24english/status/2012892950875844632?s=48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kurdistan 24</a>, showed alleged footage of al-Sharaa’s forces releasing Islamic State prisoners. According to the report, "The Syrian Arab Army releases <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISIS prisoners</a> in al-Tabqah city." </p><p>The footage has been widely posted on social media. Fox News Digital could not independently verify the video.</p><p>The State Department referred Fox News Digital to an X post from the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Tom Barrack, who also serves as the Special Envoy for Syria. Barrack wrote on X about the deal between SDF General Mazloum Abdi and al-Sharra.</p><p>"Two great Syrian leaders, driven by the shared vision of liberating their country and people from tyranny, have now come together to forge a brighter future for all Syrians. This agreement and ceasefire represent a pivotal inflection point, where former adversaries embrace partnership over division."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/syrias-christians-disappearing-trumps-moment-build-safer-federated-syria" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP HOLDS KEY TO SAVING SYRIA'S VANISHING CHRISTIANS IN CRUCIAL WHITE HOUSE MEETING</strong></a></p><p>Barrack added, "President al-Sharaa has affirmed that the Kurds are an integral part of Syria, and the United States looks forward to the seamless integration of our historic partner in the fight against ISIS with the Global Coalition’s newest member, as we press forward in the enduring battle against terrorism."</p><p>However, the People's Protection Units (YPG) commander Sipan Hamo — a Syrian organization that is part of the SDF — said on the Saturday meeting between U.S. envoy Tom Barrack and Kurdish officials produced no roadmap to a ceasefire. He denied Syria's Kurds wanted to secede or create an independent state and said their future was in Syria.</p><p>"Our greatest hope is that there will be a tangible outcome, especially from the coalition and the United States, meaning that they will intervene more forcefully in the existing problems than what they are currently doing," Hamo said.</p><p>The head of the main Kurdish forces told Reuters that the U.S. should intervene more forcefully to end a Syrian offensive that has gained key territory from Kurdish fighters in recent days.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/deadly-strike-u-s-troops-tests-trumps-counter-isis-plan-his-trust-syrias-new-leader" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEADLY STRIKE ON US TROOPS TESTS TRUMP’S COUNTER-ISIS PLAN — AND HIS TRUST IN SYRIA’S NEW LEADER</strong></a></p><p>Government troops launched an offensive on Saturday into territory run for the last decade by semi-autonomous Kurdish authorities in the northeast of Syria, capturing towns on both sides of the Euphrates River and the country's largest oil and gas field, officials and security sources said.</p><p>But given Kurdish "concerns about the changes taking place," the U.S. should offer assurances of protection to them.</p><p>Hamo said that, "In the current situation and the chaos we are living in, the only ones who can offer guarantees are the United States or the coalition," he added in a rare interview from Hasakeh province, which is still under Kurdish control.</p><p>"We believe that the responsibility for everything currently happening inside Syria lies with the Western countries, and especially the United States of America," he said.</p><p>"Of course, we consider Israel a powerful state in the region with its own agenda. We hope that the same stance taken by other countries in the region towards certain minorities in Syria will be extended to the Kurds as well," Hamo said.</p><p>Asked if he was referring to Israel's stance towards the Druze minority last summer — when Israel carried out air strikes on the defense ministry, near the presidential palace in Damascus and on Syrian troops advancing on Druze cities, Hamo said, "of course."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-syria-resume-diplomatic-dialogue-after-months-silence-under-us-mediation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ISRAEL AND SYRIA RESUME DIPLOMATIC DIALOGUE AFTER MONTHS OF SILENCE UNDER US MEDIATION</strong></a></p><p>Mutlu Civiroglu, a Kurdish affairs analyst, told Fox News Digital that, "President Trump has spoken about giving Syria and all its peoples a fresh opportunity to turn a new page. Yet, Ahmed al Sharaa’s actions appear to move against that intention, and many Kurds believe he is abusing the political space that was meant to support stability rather than deepen tensions. "</p><p>Civiroglu added that "I don’t think the U.S. is abandoning the Kurds, but President Trump’s good intention is being abused by Sharaa. Lawmakers in Washington have also expressed unease about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/middle-east" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interim Syrian government’s treatment</a> of minorities, which reflects broader questions about its commitment to inclusive governance."</p><p>Civiroglu posted footage on his popular X account of al-Sharaa supporters toppling "a statue of a female Kurdish fighter after interim Syrian government forces seized Tabqa from the SDF. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurdish fighters backed</a> by the United States had liberated the town from ISIS in May 2017."</p><p>Civiroglu said, "al-Sharaa’s confrontations with Kurdish forces, following earlier pressure on Alawite and Druze areas, reinforce doubts about the interim government’s legitimacy and its ability to represent Syria’s diverse population.</p><p>"The International community must remember that the Kurdish people have long fought alongside the United States, France and the West in the campaign against ISIS, and many are watching closely to see how these partners interpret the latest escalation," he said.</p><p>Max Abrahms, a leading expert on counter-terrorism and a professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Fox News Digital, "The YPG and then SDF were America’s primary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/terror/counter-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counterterrorism forces</a> against Islamic State in Syria during the war. Unlike the so-called "rebels," our Kurdish warrior friends exhibited both capability and moderation. It’s not surprising that the jihadists, upon taking power in Damascus, would turn their guns on the Kurdish forces. Of course, we need to stand with them."</p>
