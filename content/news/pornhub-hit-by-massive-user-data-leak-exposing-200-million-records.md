<p>Pornhub is dealing with fresh fallout after the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/hackers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacking group</a> ShinyHunters claimed responsibility for a massive user data leak. The group says it stole 94GB of data tied to more than 200 million records and is now attempting to extort the company for a Bitcoin ransom.</p><p>According to reporting from BleepingComputer, the hackers say they will publish the data if their demands are not met. Pornhub has acknowledged the situation but maintains its core systems were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not breached.</a></p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

While no financial information was included, the dataset still contains highly sensitive activity details.</p><p>The group claims the stolen records include:</p><p>Activity logs reportedly show whether a user watched or downloaded a video or viewed a channel. Search histories are also included, which raises serious privacy concerns if the data is released publicly.</p><p>The alleged breach appears linked to a separate November security incident involving Mixpanel, a data analytics vendor that previously worked with Pornhub. That earlier breach occurred after a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/alarming-rise-smishing-avoid-falling-victim"><u>smishing attack</u></a> gave threat actors access to Mixpanel systems. However, Mixpanel says it does not believe Pornhub data came from that incident. The company stated it found no evidence that the data was taken during its November 2025 breach. Pornhub has also clarified that it stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021. That means the stolen data would be several years old. Reuters contacted some Pornhub customers to verify the claims. Those users confirmed the data tied to their accounts was accurate but outdated, which aligns with the Mixpanel timeline.</p><p>Pornhub moved quickly to reassure users following the reports. In a security notice, the company said:</p><p><i>"This was not a breach of Pornhub Premium's systems. Passwords, payment details and financial information remain secure and were not exposed."</i></p><p>That distinction reduces the immediate risk of financial fraud. However, exposure of viewing habits and search activity still carries long-term privacy risks. We reached out to Pornhub for a comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/google-confirms-data-stolen-breach-known-hacker-group"><u>ShinyHunters </u></a>has been linked to some of the most disruptive data breaches this year. The group relies heavily on social engineering tactics such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/8-phishing-email-scams-watch-out-holiday-season"><u>phishing </u></a>and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/fbi-warns-dangerous-new-smishing-scam-targeting-your-phone"><u>smishing</u></a> to gain access to corporate systems. Once inside, the group typically steals large datasets and uses extortion threats to pressure companies into paying ransoms. This strategy has affected businesses and users worldwide.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/password-manager-fined-after-major-data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PASSWORD MANAGER FINED AFTER MAJOR DATA BREACH</u></strong></a></p><p>Pornhub has updated its online statement to warn Premium members about possible direct contact from cybercriminals. In cases involving adult platforms, this type of outreach often escalates into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/sextortion-scams-evolve-google-maps-images-intimidate-victims"><u>sextortion attempts</u></a>, where criminals threaten to expose private activity unless victims pay.</p><p><i>"We are aware that the individuals responsible for this incident have threatened to contact impacted Pornhub Premium users directly. You may therefore receive emails claiming they have your personal information. As a reminder, we will never ask for your password or payment information by email."</i></p><p>Pornhub remains one of the world's most visited adult video platforms. People can view content anonymously or create accounts to upload and interact with videos. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/petco-confirms-major-data-breach-involving-customer-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PETCO CONFIRMS MAJOR DATA BREACH INVOLVING CUSTOMER DATA</u></strong></a></p><p>Even if the data is several years old, users should take this opportunity to strengthen their digital security.</p><p>Start by updating your Pornhub password.

Using a password manager makes it easier to create and store strong, unique passwords.</p><p>Next, see if <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your email</a> has been exposed in past breaches.

Be cautious of emails, texts or phone calls that reference Pornhub or account issues. Avoid clicking links, downloading attachments or sharing personal information unless you can verify the source. Installing a strong antivirus program adds another layer of defense against malicious links and downloads.</p><p>The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

If leaked data from this breach is shared, resold or cross-referenced with broker databases, removing your information can make it much harder for scammers to connect it to you.</p><p>This step is especially important after high-profile breaches involving activity data.

That is especially relevant in breaches like this one, where exposed activity data may include location signals or usage patterns. While a VPN cannot erase past exposure, it reduces how much new information is visible going forward and makes it harder to link future activity back to you. Using a VPN consistently can also limit tracking across sites, which helps lower your overall digital footprint after a breach.</p><p>For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your <strong>Windows, Mac, Android &amp; iOS devices</strong> at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com</u></strong></i></p><p>The Pornhub massive data leak highlights how long stored user information can remain a risk.
