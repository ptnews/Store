<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/anthony-hopkins-refuses-play-victim-he-approaches-88-remarkable-life-advice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony Hopkins</a> is marking a major life milestone.</p><p>In an Instagram reel posted Dec. 29, the 88-year-old "Legends of the Fall" actor wished everyone a happy new year, adding he celebrated 50 years of sobriety this year.</p><p>"Here we are, another happy new year coming up. Lots of cheer, lots of fun and all that. So really have a great time," he said. "Congratulations on reaching another year, to all of you. My only problem was I had too good a time because 50 years ago today I was nearly killed by driving my car in a drunken blackout. That’s the way it was. But I realized at that point that I was having too much fun. It was called alcoholism." </p><p>He then encouraged his followers who feel like they "got a little problem with having too much" to seek help "because life is so much better."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/anthony-hopkins-calls-mental-health-labels-nonsense-dismisses-autism-diagnosis-from-his-wife" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ANTHONY HOPKINS CALLS MENTAL HEALTH LABELS 'NONSENSE,' DISMISSES AUTISM DIAGNOSIS FROM HIS WIFE</strong></a></p><p>The Academy Award-winning actor previously opened up about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/anthony-hopkins-reveals-divine-voice-ended-his-long-battle-alcohol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drunk driving experience</a> that changed his life in his memoir, "We Did Ok, Kid." In the book, he described driving all night from Arizona to Beverly Hills one night in 1975, but later having no memory doing it, writing, "I could have taken out a whole family."</p><p>"So I stopped. Without bragging, I got help and 50 years ago today was the end. Not being a killjoy, I just wish you well," he said on Instagram. "Choose life instead of the opposite. Life life life and more life. I’m also going to be 88 in two days. So maybe I did something right, I don’t know.
