<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/how-valerie-bertinelli-reclaimed-life-after-wicked-divorce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valerie Bertinelli</a> is opening up about her two divorces.</p><p>During a recent appearance on "The Drew Barrymore Show," the 65-year-old actress spoke candidly about divorce with host Drew Barrymore, who has been through three divorces herself.</p><p>On the Jan. 27 episode of the talk show, Barrymore and Bertinelli were joined by Ross Mathews during a discussion about divorce in which Barrymore brought up the new trend of divorced women turning their wedding rings into celebratory jewelry.</p><p>"I mean I've had two divorces, and they were completely different," Bertinelli said. "My last divorce, I actually, I did go back to the jeweler and sell my ring back, and I got a celebratory, like, evil eye bracelet."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hollywoods-biggest-marriages-crumble-nicole-kidman-keith-urban-more-stars-call-quits-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST MARRIAGES CRUMBLE AS NICOLE KIDMAN, KEITH URBAN AND MORE STARS CALL IT QUITS IN 2025</strong></a></p><p>Barrymore seemed to be a fan of the trend, saying divorce can often be "a source of shame," noting this new trend is a great way to "lift someone's spirits when they feel like they have failed."</p><p>She went on to call her three divorces "as awful as anything I've ever experienced," and that this trend is a "weird tone change," which brings "some empowerment [and] some rebelliousness."</p><p><i>"</i>It's like the celebratory part of it, because, I mean, there's a celebration of not being in that pain any longer, but there was love at one point between those – I mean at some point," Bertinelli agreed.</p><p>The "Hot in Cleveland" star was married to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/valerie-bertinelli-admits-eddie-van-halen-not-soulmate-marriage-declined-drugs-infidelity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eddie Van Halen</a> from 1981 until 2007 and then financial planner Tom Vitale from 2011 until 2022.

One month prior, she shared a similar account on Instagram.</p><p>"I have been screamed at so many times and told how fat and lazy I am," Bertinelli said on social media in January 2023. "I realize … that was someone just projecting on me whatever they needed to project on me, but my part in all of it was believing it, and I don't believe it anymore. But it still doesn't stop the feelings from coming up and the hurt."</p><p>The "One Day at a Time" star later announced she was in a new relationship in March 2024 with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/valerie-bertinelli-admits-eddie-van-halen-not-soulmate-marriage-declined-drugs-infidelity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Goodnough</a>, telling USA Today at the time that her relationship with him was "unlike any relationship that I’ve ever experienced with a man."</p><p>She and Goodnough dated for 10 months, ultimately calling it quits in November 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
