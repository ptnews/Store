The prosperity I intend to deliver and the leadership that has too long been lacking."</p><p>Kassem thanked Mamdani for the appointment, saying he considers it a "call of duty to serve the city that I've called home, the city that embraced me."</p><p>"I grew up in war-torn countries in the Middle East, authoritarian regimes, and New York City was really my first stable and permanent home," said Kassem. "This is an opportunity for me to repay that debt. I've been trying to repay that debt ever since I came to this country, ever since I immigrated."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/20-nyc-mayor-elect-mamdani-transition-appointees-have-anti-zionist-ties-adl"><strong>20% OF NYC MAYOR-ELECT MAMDANI TRANSITION APPOINTEES HAVE ANTI-ZIONIST TIES: ADL</strong></a></p><p>Kassem is the founder of the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability &amp; Responsibility (CLEAR) law clinic, a project that, according to its website, has a mandate "to support Muslim and all other client, communities, and movements in the New York City area and beyond that are targeted by local, state, or federal government agencies under the guise of national security and counterterrorism."</p>
