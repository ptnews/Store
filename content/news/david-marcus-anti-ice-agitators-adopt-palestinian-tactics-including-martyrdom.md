<p>The highly organized groups of agitators in Minneapolis, coordinated online to harass federal immigration agents (or anyone in an SUV it seems), have begun to employ tactics that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any Israeli</a> would recognize from decades of terrorism in their country.</p><p>The basic idea employed by both the Minnesota leftists and Hamas, is to be as menacing as possible to authorities, including through acts of violence, and then, when the authorities strike back, to claim victimhood and martyrdom.</p><p>The tragic and needless <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/alex-pretti-37-identified-man-fatally-shot-border-patrol-agent-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of Alex Pretti</a> on Friday morning, was a terrible example of this phenomenon, one that, sadly and unconscionably, is being not just tolerated by Minnesota officials, but shamelessly encouraged.</p><p>The video of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-blocks-trump-admin-destroying-altering-evidence-deadly-minneapolis-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the shooting is vague</a>, and it will take time and testimony to piece together the chain of events that led to Pretti’s death. But there are a few facts that seem clear, and they all point to an organized effort to antagonize and provoke <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law enforcement</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/todd-blanche-warns-americans-should-worried-about-minnesota-protests-after-church-disruption" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TODD BLANCHE WARNS AMERICANS 'SHOULD BE WORRIED' ABOUT MINNESOTA PROTESTS AFTER CHURCH DISRUPTION</strong></a></p><p>Pretti left home Friday with a gun and extra ammunition and a plan to impede <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal agents</a>, which is exactly what he seemed to be doing when he allegedly intervened in the arrest of a suspect.</p><p>It is reasonable to assume that Pretti brought the gun and extra clips in anticipation of a potential confrontation with law enforcement. Can we know that for sure? No. Is it more likely than not? Absolutely.</p><p>The key point here is that no matter how much one may cherish the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/second-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Second Amendment</a>, nobody has a right to carry a gun while committing a felony, because to do so obviously puts everyone involved in harm’s way.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-urges-dhs-ice-publicize-arrests-says-crackdown-saving-many-innocent-lives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP URGES DHS, ICE TO PUBLICIZE ARRESTS, SAYS CRACKDOWN IS 'SAVING MANY INNOCENT LIVES'</strong></a></p><p>Pretti’s defenders are disingenuously arguing that he was merely enjoying his rights as a gun owner while protesting, which would be perfectly fine, except there was no protest. Instead, he was involved in direct, illegal action to interfere with the feds.</p><p>This is why reports, from all sides, say that the crowd of hundreds did not gather until <i>after</i> the shooting, which is exactly what happened in the case of Renee Good, who was also breaking the law with a deadly weapon, in that case, her SUV.</p><p>The tactic here is clear as day: organize hordes of people to harass federal agents all day, then cross the line into breaking the law in order to create a flash point, even if that means people have to die.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-says-minneapolis-suspect-committed-domestic-terrorism-accuses-walz-frey-inciting-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NOEM SAYS MINNEAPOLIS SUSPECT COMMITTED ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM,’ ACCUSES WALZ, FREY OF INCITING VIOLENCE</strong></a></p><p>This is straight out of the Palestinian playbook: cause just enough harm to provoke a reaction, then claim the reaction is disproportionate and evil, as in, "We just sent a suicide bomber, you used missiles, no fair!"</p><p>Let’s be clear, if you choose to fight with federal agents while they attempt to arrest a criminal and you bring a gun to that fight, you stand a very, very good chance of getting shot. </p><p>But this was more than just a bad decision by Pretti. These types of actions have been cynically sanctioned by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/frey-klobuchar-call-ice-leave-minneapolis-following-deadly-cbp-shooting-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local elected officials</a> such as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a>, and state Attorney General Keith Ellison.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-agitators-stalk-pelt-border-patrol-agents-food-spit-gas-stations-dhs-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA AGITATORS STALK, PELT BORDER PATROL AGENTS WITH FOOD AND SPIT AT GAS STATIONS, DHS SAYS</strong></a></p><p>To date, none of them have firmly told citizens to stop organizing to impede federal agents. It's hard not to come to the conclusion that the deaths are good politics for them in their one battle after another against President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>.</p><p>Frey, and Walz and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats in general</a> will hide behind the well-worn phrase, "peaceful protest," but will never say exactly what peaceful protest includes.</p><p>Does peaceful protest include storming churches? Does it include using your car to hinder investigations? Does it include carrying a gun while committing a felony? They won’t address any of this, and the only reason why, not that makes any sense, is that they like the results.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mob-violence-minnesota-isnt-free-speech-its-grounds-insurrection-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MOB VIOLENCE IN MINNESOTA ISN’T FREE SPEECH — IT’S GROUNDS FOR THE INSURRECTION ACT</strong></a></p><p>After the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-says-walz-frey-incited-chaos-after-anti-ice-mob-storms-minneapolis-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of Good</a>, conservatives pleaded with Democrats to tell their followers to stand down from illegally impeding agents. We warned, very specifically, that it would cause more death. But <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/governors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frey and Walz</a> just didn’t care.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</u></strong></a></p><p>Sadly, we were right. </p><p>One lesson that Israel has learned in fighting an enemy that wants to or is willing to die, is that the reaction to Israelis defending themselves is widespread moral outrage and condemnation. The other lesson is that they have to do it anyway.</p><p>This is the conundrum that the Trump administration finds itself in today. They could throw in the towel and leave the Twin Cities to their own devices, but doing so would be the end of federal law.</p><p>No, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the administration</a> must hold firm, in the face of public outrage, in the face of midterm worries, and in the face of the shameless harassment of their agents.</p><p>It is up to Minnesotans if they wish to create more martyrs to their cause, and sadly, given the support for lawlessness seen from Frey and Walz, we can expect more, sooner rather than later.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/david-marcus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS</u></strong></a></p>
