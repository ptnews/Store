<p>A metal detectorist's lucky find has become the Scottish government's gain — and experts say it's the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oldest Scotland-made coin</a> ever found.</p><p>The 900-year-old coin, which bears the image of David I, a 12th-century king, recently went into the possession of National Museums Scotland (NMS), a public body of the Scottish Government.</p><p>Pictures of the small coin show it has darkened with age and bears signs of patina, though the symbols are still faintly visible.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/long-lost-ancient-village-mysterious-past-unearthed-during-wind-farm-dig-exciting-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LONG-LOST ANCIENT VILLAGE WITH MYSTERIOUS PAST UNEARTHED AMID WIND FARM DIG: 'EXCITING DISCOVERY'</strong></a></p><p>Alice Blackwell, a curator at NMS, told Fox News Digital the coin was found by a metal detectorist near a town called Penicuik, some 10 miles south of Edinburgh, in 2023.</p><p>The hobbyist promptly reported the find to Scotland's Treasure Trove Unit.</p><p>David I, considered one of the most important leaders in Scottish history, ruled from 1124 to 1153. </p><p>He's known for reshaping the Scottish government, expanding royal authority and being one of the few Scottish kings to be canonized by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Catholic Church</a>.</p><p>.<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>In the 1130s, David I introduced Scotland's first coinage. Experts have dated the coin to the 12th century, and no other known Scottish coins are as old — a fact that makes the find particularly significant.</p><p>"[David I] took territorial control of Cumbria and its mines, then used the existing English mint <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/historic-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Carlisle</a> to produce the first Scottish coins," said Blackwell. "Henry II later reclaimed the territory for England in 1157."</p><p>The small coin bears the image of David I on one side and a cross-based design on the other, Blackwell noted.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"It also bears an inscription indicating it was minted <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Edinburgh,</a> making it the earliest example of a Scottish coin produced from a core Scottish mint," she said.</p><p>The curator added that David I later established mints in Perth, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Aberdeen, St. Andrews and Roxburgh in the Scottish Borders.</p><p>"His reign [also] included the foundation of royal burghs such as Edinburgh, Perth, Dunfermline and Stirling, and the reorganization of civil institutions."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>The coin is a penny, Blackwell said — but it's difficult to say what it would be worth in modern currency.</p><p>"Determining the modern economic value today is complex," she said, adding there were no immediate plans for public display.</p><p>Scotland continues to yield interesting archaeological discoveries. </p><p>Months ago, excavators at Culloden Battlefield unearthed new secrets from the final moments of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/archaeologists-uncover-new-secrets-final-moments-countrys-bloodiest-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scotland's bloodiest battle.</a></p><p>At Islay, a remote island off Scotland's western coast, archaeologists <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/forgotten-medieval-kingdoms-grand-castle-emerges-after-decades-research-scotland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a <u>grand castle</u></a> affiliated with a long-forgotten medieval kingdom.</p>
