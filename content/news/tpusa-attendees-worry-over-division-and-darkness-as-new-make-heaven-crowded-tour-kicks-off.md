It's not," she said Wednesday. "If we want to continue the wildfire of this revival across the nation, our mission is simple. It's always been simple. It's always been simple. Bring people to Jesus. Make heaven crowded."</p><p><a href="https://www.makeheavencrowdedtour.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The "Make Heaven Crowded" tour</a> currently has 28 listed events across the United States, with eight of them having confirmed dates.</p><p>"The world is very divided right now, especially when it comes to values and beliefs," another spectator from Anaheim Hills named Maddie added.</p><p>"This event is really important to just connect the younger generation and show them who Jesus is. There's a lot of division in our generation, especially, but in the world in general, and I just feel like God's light needs to be shown more in these situations, especially because there's a lot of darkness in the world," she said.</p>
