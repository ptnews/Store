"I want retribution from NBCUniversal [and other parties involved], not just for me, for my father, for me, and for my little sister — my father's true descendants — because they screwed us over.</p><p>"Everybody thinks it's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such a wonderful film</a>, it's so touching," he added. "It's all lies. And it steals all the hard work that my father put in his entire life so that Claire, Rachel and Dayna can soak up a massive paycheck."</p><p>While Hudson did not comment on what Mike Jr. had to say, she expressed gratitude for getting to meet Claire and have her involved in the movie.</p><p>"I’m so happy that I got to know Claire, who’s such a wonderful woman, and she’s so happy with the movie," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
