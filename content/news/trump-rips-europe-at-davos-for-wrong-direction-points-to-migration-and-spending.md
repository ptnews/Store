<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> blasted European nations for not being "recognizable" at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday. </p><p>"I don't want to insult anybody and say I don't recognize it," Trump said during his special address Wednesday. "And that's not in a positive way. That's in a very negative way. And I love Europe and I want to see Europe do good, but it's not heading in the right direction."</p><p>"In recent decades, it became conventional wisdom in Washington and European capitals that the only way to grow a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/economic-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern Western economy</a> was through ever-increasing government spending, unchecked mass migration, and endless foreign imports," Trump said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/greenlands-prime-minister-says-we-choose-denmark-over-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>GREENLAND'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS 'WE CHOOSE DENMARK' OVER THE US</u></strong></a> </p><p>Trump then said that issues like energy, trade, immigration and economic growth must be "central concerns to anyone who wants to see a strong and united West." </p><p>Trump’s comments come as tensions between the U.S. and European allies have escalated, after Trump has renewed his ambitions to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire Greenland</a> and has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/davos-braces-trump-amid-tensions-over-nato-greenland-global-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened to impose tariffs</a> on European allies who don’t back those efforts.</p><p>In response to a group of NATO members dispatching <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/troops-from-europe-deploy-greenland-rapid-2-day-mission-trump-eyes-us-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>troops to Greenland</u></a> after Trump resurrected his plans to take over the island, the president announced Saturday that those countries would be subjected to a 10% tariff on all goods starting Feb. 1. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-congressional-delegation-visits-denmark-amid-backlash-over-trumps-push-acquire-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION VISITS DENMARK AMID BACKLASH OVER TRUMP'S PUSH TO ACQUIRE GREENLAND</strong></a></p><p>Those tariffs would increase to 25% in June, until a deal is reached for Trump to secure Greenland, according to Trump. </p><p>Trump's comments in Davos echo previous statements Vice President JD Vance made at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025. There, Vance cautioned that Russia and China don't pose as great a threat to European nations as the "threat from within," citing censorship and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>illegal immigration</u></a>. </p><p>Additionally, Vance said that European voters didn’t endorse opening the "floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants."</p><p>European leaders bucked at Vance's comments, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said shortly after Vance delivered the statement that he perceived the statements as a comparison to "conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes."</p><p>Trump previously attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, twice during his first term, according to the State Department’s records. </p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p>
