<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> blasted European nations for not being "recognizable" at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday. </p><p>"I don't want to insult anybody and say I don't recognize it," Trump said during his special address Wednesday. "And that's not in a positive way. That's in a very negative way. And I love Europe and I want to see Europe do good, but it's not heading in the right direction."</p><p>"In recent decades, it became conventional wisdom in Washington and European capitals that the only way to grow a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/economic-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern Western economy</a> was through ever increasing government spending, unchecked mass migration, and endless foreign imports," Trump said. </p><p>Trump then said that issues like energy, trade, immigration and economic growth must be "central concerns to anyone who wants to see a strong and united West." </p><p>Trump’s comments come as tensions between the U.S. and European allies have escalated, after Trump has renewed his ambitions to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire Greenland</a> and has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/davos-braces-trump-amid-tensions-over-nato-greenland-global-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatened to impose tariffs</a> on European allies who don’t back those efforts.</p><p><i>This is a breaking story and will be updated. </i></p>
