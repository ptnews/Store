<p>The man accused of fatally stabbing a woman inside a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palm Beach Gardens</a> Barnes &amp; Noble days before Christmas had traveled through several states before entering Florida, authorities said Tuesday.</p><p>Palm Beach Gardens police identified the suspect as Antonio R. Moore, 40, and said he is accused of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-florida-barnes-noble-stabbed-death-police-seek-motive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killing 65-year-old Rita B. Loncharich</a> inside the popular bookstore on the evening of Dec. 22.</p><p>Investigators said Moore is not a Florida resident and had moved through multiple states, including through Georgia and North Carolina, before coming to Florida. Police said Moore boarded a bus on Dec. 15 from Orlando to Titusville and then traveled onward into Palm Beach County.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-florida-barnes-noble-stabbed-death-police-seek-motive" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WOMAN IN FLORIDA BARNES &amp; NOBLE STABBED TO DEATH, POLICE SEEK MOTIVE</strong></a></p><p>According to the arrest affidavit obtained by <a href="https://www.wflx.com/2025/12/30/suspect-fatal-palm-beach-gardens-bookstore-stabbing-traveled-through-multiple-states-before-attack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WFLX Fox 29</a>, Moore entered the bookstore around 7:29 p.m. and Loncharich arrived shortly afterward. Investigators said Moore approached Loncharich in a store aisle and stabbed her in the back with a pocketknife.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/crime/2025/12/30/barnes-noble-stabbing-murder-suspect-palm-beach-gardens-bookstore/87960588007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=true&amp;gca-epti=z118624p116050c116050d00----v118624d--42--b--42--&amp;gca-ft=207&amp;gca-ds=sophi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Palm Beach Post</a>, Moore allegedly told police a "fight or flight" response overtook him, and he took a fixed-blade knife from his jacket pocket. He reportedly told police that he stabbed Loncharich because she was the closest person to him at the time and said he did not have any prior interaction with her.</p><p>Bystanders helped the victim until first responders arrived, the local outlet reported. Loncharich was transported to St. Mary’s Medical Center, where she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died during surgery</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-violent-criminal-history-parole-allegedly-stabs-teen-death-officials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MAN WITH VIOLENT CRIMINAL HISTORY ON PAROLE ALLEGEDLY STABS TEEN TO DEATH: OFFICIALS</u></strong></a></p><p>Police received a 911 call at 7:52 p.m. and located Moore several blocks from the scene minutes later. He was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken into custody</a> without incident.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/homeless-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore, who police say is homeless</a>, told investigators he had no prior relationship with the victim and offered no motive for the attack. According to authorities, he admitted to sitting in the store charging his phone just before the stabbing.</p><p>Jail records from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office</a> show that Moore was booked on a charge of first-degree premeditated murder. He is being held without bond.</p><p>Local family members and community members described Loncharich as a "kind, gentle" person whose life was cut short during what should have been a routine holiday outing.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department for comment.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Greg Norman contributed to this report.</i></p>
