<p>On-site marijuana consumption has received the green light in the Bay State, allowing hospitality businesses to offer cannabis to consumers.</p><p>The Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (MCCC) unanimously approved the decision in a 4-0 vote on Dec. 11. Under the new rule, non-cannabis businesses <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as yoga studios</a> and movie theaters can obtain a cannabis license to host consumption areas.</p><p>"The first new cannabis business models to be introduced to Massachusetts’ regulated industry in five years will allow adults ages 21 and older to buy and consume cannabis on-site at licensed Marijuana Establishments (MEs), sanctioned events and non-cannabis businesses that partner with licensees," the MCCC press release notes.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/smoking-vaping-may-banned-one-states-most-popular-beaches-parks-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SMOKING AND VAPING MAY BE BANNED AT ONE STATE'S MOST POPULAR BEACHES AND PARKS: HERE'S WHY</strong></a></p><p>Chair Shannon O’Brien said Massachusetts residents have been "eagerly" waiting to socially consume marijuana, according to the release.</p><p>"We look forward to the economic opportunities these new license types will offer to small businesses and entrepreneurs who have been disproportionately harmed by the war on drugs," said O’Brien.</p><p>The regulations take effect immediately. Social consumption licenses, however, are not yet available.</p><p>The commission will be working on an implementation plan to create new consumption establishment applications along with guidance and vendor training, the release noted.</p><p>MCCC recently praised President Donald Trump for his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-order-reclassify-marijuana-less-dangerous-drug-amid-gop-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive order in December</a> reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER </strong></a></p><p>Marijuana previously was labeled a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/federal-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schedule 1 drug</a> under the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations — the same category the agency uses for drugs including heroin, ecstasy and LSD.</p><p>Under the new Schedule III classification, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marijuana is now in a category</a> alongside drugs like Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids, which the agency claims arethe  ones with a "moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence."</p><p>"President Trump’s Executive Order expediting rescheduling of cannabis marks a significant step forward for public health and patient care in the United States," said Commissioner Kimberly Roy in a press release at the time.  </p><p>"By aligning federal policy more closely with science, this action will help remove long-standing barriers to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical research</a> and open the door to safer, more effective treatments for people living with chronic and debilitating conditions," Roy added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</strong></a></p><p>In a recent study, researchers at UC San Francisco determined that eating edible cannabis, such as gummies, has the same impact on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">cardiovascular risk</a> as smoking marijuana.</p><p>The risk stems from reduced blood vessel function, with the study finding that cannabis users were found to have "decreased vascular function," comparable to those who smoke tobacco.</p><p>Their blood vessel function was roughly half compared to those who did not use cannabis, with the side effect linked to a higher risk of heart attack, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high blood pressure</a> and other cardiovascular conditions, the researchers noted.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>"Chronic cannabis smoking and THC ingestion were associated with endothelial dysfunction [impaired functioning of the endothelial cells lining the inside of blood vessels] similar to that observed in tobacco smokers, although apparently occurring via distinct mechanisms," the researchers wrote.</p><p>"This study enhances the understanding of the potential risks to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health/circulation-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vascular health</a> linked to cannabis use and provides more evidence that cannabis use is not benign."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Massachusetts Department of Health for comment.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Melissa Rudy and Diana Stancey contributed reporting. </i></p>
