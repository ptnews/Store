<p>Some of America’s safest cities are in jurisdictions that cooperate with ICE, a trend also shaped by wealth and zoning — with a handful of notable exceptions.</p><p>Most of the 10 safest cities on <a href="https://realestate.usnews.com/places/rankings/safest-places-to-live" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. News &amp; World Report's list</a> are located either in states or counties that have laws directing municipal authorities to cooperate or coordinate directly with federal immigration enforcement. That cooperation often occurs through 287(g) agreements, which allow local law enforcement agencies to work directly with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The cities also share other traits, such as high median incomes and a lack of mixed-use zoning or transient rental housing, underscoring the ongoing debate over whether immigration enforcement cooperation plays a meaningful role in public safety.</p><p>Johns Creek, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia</a> — named the safest city in America by<i> </i>U.S. News &amp; World Report — is governed under state laws requiring cooperation with federal immigration authorities, placing it among several highly ranked cities in similar jurisdictions while leaving open the role of income, development patterns and local demographics in shaping the results.</p><p>While situated in Fulton County and not far from its relatively dangerous county seat of Atlanta, Johns Creek falls under a stringent state law mandating local-federal cooperation, enacted in the wake of Laken Riley’s murder.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/arkansas-county-jail-becomes-major-ice-pipeline-arrests-surge-trump-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ARKANSAS COUNTY JAIL BECOMES MAJOR ICE PIPELINE AS ARRESTS SURGE UNDER TRUMP CRACKDOWN</strong></a></p><p>The sweeping Georgia Criminal Alien Track and Report Act of 2024 requires local police to forge agreements with federal authorities to assist in immigration enforcement. Any jurisdiction that neglects to seek cooperation with DHS may lose state funding, according to the <a href="https://leitf.org/2024/07/leitf-explainer-the-georgia-criminal-alien-track-and-report-act-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force</a>.</p><p>"If you are in our country illegally and committing crimes, you have no place in Georgia," Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/brian-kemp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Kemp</a> said after signing the law.</p><p>The second-safest city on the list, by contrast, limits cooperation with the feds at the local level, but until late January saw its state police fully engaged in cooperation with federal authorities.</p><p>Centreville, Virginia, an exurb of Washington, falls within Fairfax County — where the prosecutor’s office has made news for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-rips-dem-run-county-after-illegal-immigrant-murderer-released-blood-hands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noncompliance with ICE detainers</a> — but where its recently departed Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) repeatedly cited his 287(g) agreement with the feds, which current Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/abigail-spanberger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abigail Spanberger</a> (D) reversed upon her inauguration.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scourge-sexual-predators-violent-criminals-being-removed-from-minneapolis-streets-despite-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>‘SCOURGE’ OF SEXUAL PREDATORS, VIOLENT CRIMINALS BEING REMOVED FROM MINNEAPOLIS STREETS DESPITE BACKLASH</strong></a></p><p>Centreville, near John Foster Dulles International Airport and just off regional artery I-66, also has a low 6% poverty rate and lacks the mixed-use development and transient rental properties that experts have said often beget crime.</p><p>The other two outliers on the list, Sammamish, Washington, and Newton, Massachusetts, at eighth and third respectively, have a similar residential, low-mixed-use makeup and relatively high median income. Newton’s "welcoming city" ordinance and Washington state’s Keep Washington Working Act preclude most cooperation with ICE.</p><p>The rest of the list of safest places to live in the U.S. falls squarely under state or local laws with some of the most pro-cooperation dynamics in the country.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kristi-noem-announces-more-than-150-illegal-immigrant-sex-offenders-arrested-massive-florida-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KRISTI NOEM ANNOUNCES MORE THAN 150 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT SEX OFFENDERS ARRESTED IN MASSIVE FLORIDA CRACKDOWN</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denton County, Texas</a>, where No. 10 Flower Mound is situated, was the first North Texas county to shift its 287(g) agreement from the more passive "jail model" — where honoring of ICE detainers is standard — to the "task force model," where select officers can detain people based on suspicion of federal immigration law violations, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/politics/denton-county-expands-controversial-287g-ice-agreement/287-2c818ef4-37d4-4d7e-8974-8445cc1c9859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">according to Dallas’ ABC affiliate.</a></p><p>"It’s what we do — we enforce the law and it’s the law of the land," Denton Sheriff Tracy Murphree told the outlet.</p><p>Flower Mound also falls under Texas SB 8, which provides grants to fast-track officer training to move agencies from "jail" to "task force" 287(g) models.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-alien-24-convictions-among-worst-of-worst-arrested-minnesota-ice-operation-dhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ILLEGAL ALIEN WITH 24 CONVICTIONS AMONG ‘WORST OF THE WORST’ ARRESTED IN MINNESOTA ICE OPERATION: DHS</strong></a></p><p>No. 5 Homosassa Springs and No. 9 Weston both fall in Florida, home to one of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more stringent state pro-cooperation policies</a>.</p><p>The TRUMP Act of 2025 — Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy — also designated the state Agriculture Commissioner as chief immigration officer.</p><p>With Homosassa in red Citrus County on the Gulf Coast and Weston in blue Broward County on the Atlantic Coast, the state law effectively places both on a level field in terms of immigration enforcement requirements, despite historical differences.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-demands-mn-leaders-honor-ice-detainers-alleges-hundreds-criminal-aliens-have-been-released-under-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DHS DEMANDS MN LEADERS HONOR ICE DETAINERS, ALLEGES HUNDREDS OF CRIMINAL ALIENS HAVE BEEN RELEASED UNDER WALZ</strong></a></p><p>Carmel and Fishers, Indiana, located near each other in suburban Hamilton County, fall at Nos. 7 and 6 on the U.S. News list.
