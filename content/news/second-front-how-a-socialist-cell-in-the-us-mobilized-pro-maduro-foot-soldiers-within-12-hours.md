<p>As the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-military-details-timeline-operation-capture-maduro-revealing-more-than-150-aircraft-involved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. military carried out a daring operation</a> to capture Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, a second front opened up within minutes in the United States  an information warfare, psychological and propaganda operation run by a hardened cell of self-described Marxist, socialist and communist leaders.</p><p>For years, this cell has fomented anti-American hate in the U.S. under the cover of "anti-war" protests, rallying activists after the 9/11 attacks to condemn the U.S. response, appropriating "anti-racism" protests after the 2020 killing of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/george-floyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Floyd</a>, marching with Antifa agitators, organizing antisemitic campus encampments after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas and activating "working-class Americans" to support Maduro and his regime in a war against "U.S. imperialism."</p><p>A Fox News Digital analysis of their minute-by-minute moves overnight reveals how this network activated a coordinated ideological and information warfare campaign, moving through digital social media channels with quickly produced posters to mobilize foot soldiers to the streets for an "EMERGENCY DAY OF ACTION" in New York City; Washington, D.C.; and an estimated 100 other cities, moving with the speed and discipline of an organized military operation.</p><p>At 1:35 a.m., as U.S. special forces teams had just landed in Venezuela, BreakThrough News, a socialist propaganda arm of the network, <a href="https://x.com/BTnewsroom/status/2007339954305929586?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>published</u></a> some of the first video from the U.S. military strikes, blasting the Trump administration for waging an "illegal bombing campaign of Caracas," the capital of Venezuela.

Singham didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/maduro-met-chinese-envoy-hours-before-us-capture-from-caracas-beijing-slams-operation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MADURO MET CHINESE ENVOY HOURS BEFORE US CAPTURE FROM CARACAS AS BEIJING SLAMS OPERATION</strong></a></p><p>By 3:21 a.m., Vijay Prashad, director of <a href="https://thetricontinental.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research</u></a>, a research institute chaired by Singham that examines issues through the lens of "national liberation Marxism," <a href="https://x.com/vijayprashad/status/2007366655534608630?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>posted</u></a> a message, denouncing the military action, declaring, "Down with US imperialism."</p><p>Within a few hours, at 6:09 a.m., CodePink, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded by Singham’s wife, Jodie Evans, <a href="https://x.com/codepink/status/2007408925965201732?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>condemned</u></a> the "terrorist United States…"</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/maduro-jailed-new-york-detention-center-held-diddy-ghislaine-maxwell-sam-bankman-fried" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MADURO JAILED AT NEW YORK DETENTION CENTER THAT HELD DIDDY, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, AND SAM BANKMAN-FRIED</strong></a></p><p>From a military intelligence perspective, experts say the overnight sequence bears the hallmarks of a pre-positioned influence network executing a rapid-response operation. The synchronization of messaging, the staggered release of content across aligned platforms and the immediate transition from online agitation to physical mobilization point to an ecosystem designed not for spontaneous protest, but for ideological warfare.</p><p>In this framework, experts say, the nonprofit leaders are foot soldiers in Maduro’s war on the United States, acting as civilian operatives advancing the strategic interests of a foreign ideological project. Their role is not to fight with weapons, but to contest legitimacy, shape public perception, apply internal pressure on U.S. decision-making during moments of external conflict and further the cause of communism, experts say.</p><p>At the center of this domestic front is an international coordination structure known as the <a href="https://ipa-aip.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>International Peoples’ Assembly</u></a>, which functions as an umbrella organization and political command-and-control hub linking communist parties, socialist movements, activist organizations and state-aligned media outlets worldwide. </p><p>One of its media arms, <a href="https://peoplesdispatch.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the People’s Dispatch</a>, has explicitly framed its mission as mobilizing global resistance against "American imperialism," including repeated calls to action on behalf of Venezuela. It <a href="https://ipa-aip.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>lists</u></a> Singham’s Tricontinental as one of its "partners." The North America members of its "coordinating committee" <a href="https://ipa-aip.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>include</u></a> CodePink; the Popular Education Project, an<a href="https://peoplesforum.org/instructor/popular-education-project/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u> initiative</u></a> of The People’s Forum; and the Party for Socialism and Liberation. Its Venezuelan member is a group called Francisco de Miranda Front, which works closely with its U.S. allies.</p><p>At 7:49 a.m., the International People’s Assembly <a href="https://x.com/peoplesassembl_/status/2007434198030655591?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>shared</u></a> the poster for the "EMERGENCY DAY OF ACTION."</p><p>It quickly published <a href="https://ipa-aip.org/official-statement/stop-the-us-war-on-venezuela/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>a statement</u></a> condemning the U.S. military action as reflective of the country’s "increasingly militaristic and hyper-imperialist orientation" and calling on members to "resist this pursuit of hegemony by any means necessary."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-us-run-venezuela-until-safe-transition-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP VOWS US WILL 'RUN' VENEZUELA UNTIL 'SAFE' TRANSITION OF POWER</strong></a></p><p>The assembly operates in close alignment with Tricontinental, the SIngham organization that functions as an ideological production center, generating narratives, research and messaging disseminated through aligned media platforms and activated through street-level organizations. Singham’s wife, Evans, sits on the International People’s Assembly, tightening the operational loop between messaging, mobilization and leadership.</p><p>Experts say the ideological doctrine guiding this network is shaped in part by Prashad, who also serves as editor of People’s Dispatch. </p><p>On the operational side, De Los Santos, executive director at The People’s Forum, has emerged as a visible field organizer. He is<a href="https://peoplesforum.org/about/staff/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> listed</a> as a researcher at Tricontinental and has repeatedly appeared at regime-aligned events in Venezuela, functioning as a liaison between the ideological center and street-level mobilization abroad and at home.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/maduro-gave-state-tv-address-us-strikes-venezuela-began-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MADURO GAVE STATE TV ADDRESS AS US STRIKES IN VENEZUELA BEGAN: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>In 2003, Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez <a href="https://peoplesdispatch.org/2019/01/31/strengthening-the-revolution-is-part-of-everyday-life-in-venezuela/#:~:text=Ana%20Maldonado:%20The%20organization%2C%20Frente,of%20the%20issue%20of%20identity." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>backed</u></a> a new group in Venezuela, the Francisco de Miranda Front, laying the groundwork for an international solidarity apparatus that joined the International People’s Assembly, working with U.S. groups. That infrastructure matured over time into a durable support system for Maduro when he was elected president in 2013.</p><p>By March 2019, that relationship was well-entrenched when De Los Santos <a href="https://peoplesdispatch.org/2019/03/19/protestors-block-venezuelan-oppositions-attempt-to-occupy-consulate-building-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>organized</u></a> a pro-Maduro protest outside Venezuela’s consulate in New York, physically denying opposition figures access to the building.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-casts-maduros-ouster-smart-move-russia-china-enter-fray" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP CASTS MADURO’S OUSTER AS ‘SMART’ MOVE AS RUSSIA, CHINA ENTER THE FRAY</strong></a></p><p>That month, the Party for Socialism and Liberation’s Claudia De la Cruz jetted to Venezuela for a four-day conference of the International Peoples’ Assembly in Caracas, urging socialists to "collectivize" their efforts to fight the "capitalist crisis" in the world, according to <a href="https://youtu.be/WF54vgAoAjo?si=vKteeKGkRdUCAryk&amp;t=62" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>a video</u></a> shared from the meeting with the hashtag #HandsOffVenezuela..</p><p>"Venezuela is the epicenter," she declared. "Venezuela is the personification of the anti-imperialist struggle."</p><p>The next month, The People’s Forum hosted Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza during a talk in which he demanded the U.S. end sanctions on the country, according to <a href="https://fightbacknews.org/articles/venezuelan-minister-foreign-affairs-arreaza-addresses-nyc-activists" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>an article</u></a> in "Fight Back!

He noted that he stood with De Los Santos and Maduro, supporting "sovereignty against imperialism." </p><p>The next month, De Los Santos participated in a Caracas conference <a href="https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1mrxmaDdDOWxy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>livestreamed</u></a> on Maduro’s X account, speaking at the 59-minute mark and holding up a manifesto, "Plan para salvar la humanidad," or "Plan to save humanity."</p><p>He returned to Caracas in April 2022 for the International Anti-Fascist Summit, posting a photo with Eugene Puryear, a senior figure in the Party for Socialism and Liberation, further reinforcing the operational linkage between U.S.-based activists and foreign political structures.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-democrat-calls-trumps-maduro-capture-welcome-news-left-accuses-him-illegal-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOUSE DEMOCRAT CALLS TRUMP'S MADURO CAPTURE 'WELCOME NEWS' AS LEFT ACCUSES HIM OF 'ILLEGAL ACTIONS'</strong></a></p><p>The pattern intensified the next year when De Los Santos and De la Cruz attended a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8dYGzSO-WU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>conference</u></a> sponsored by the Maduro government to explicitly preserve the ideological legacy of "Comandante Chávez," their term of reverence for Chávez.</p><p>In late April 2024, Maduro even <a href="https://youtu.be/3qYFK4qvrZM?si=1h0HdZ5N5iAkggTr&amp;t=739" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>recognized</u></a> De Los Santos as he thanked attendees of a conference of the "Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America," established by Cuba and Venezuela in 2004 to unite communist economic interests.</p><p>This past fall, a <a href="https://iacenter.org/2025/11/17/urgent-call-for-a-week-of-coordinated-protests-to-stop-u-s-war-against-venezuela-nov-15-23/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>wide network</u></a> that included the Communist Party USA, the All-African People’s Revolutionary Party and the Struggle for Socialism Party supported an "urgent call for a week of coordinated protests" to support Maduro.
