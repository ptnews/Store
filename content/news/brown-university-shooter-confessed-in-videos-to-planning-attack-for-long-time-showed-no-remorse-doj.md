<p>Federal prosecutors on Tuesday released transcripts of short videos they say were recorded by the gunman responsible for a mass shooting at Brown University and the killing of an MIT professor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Massachusetts</a>.</p><p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts said investigators recovered an electronic device containing the videos when they executed a federal search warrant on Dec. 18, 2025, at a storage facility used by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/claudio-manuel-neves-valente-identified-brown-university-shooting-suspect-found-dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claudio Manuel Neves Valente</a>, whom authorities described as "the Portuguese national responsible for the senseless murders."</p><p>The videos were recorded in Portuguese and later translated into English, prosecutors said. In the recordings, Neves Valente described <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/mass-shootings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the attack</a> as the culmination of long planning.</p><p>"It's done. It was, it was six months, man. Not six months, six semesters. Uh. I had already planned this for a little more," he said in one video, according to the transcripts.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/dispatch-records-brown-university-shooting-capture-chaos-deadly-campus-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DISPATCH RECORDS FROM BROWN UNIVERSITY SHOOTING CAPTURE CHAOS OF DEADLY CAMPUS ATTACK</strong></a></p><p>Authorities said Neves Valente identified Brown University as his intended target but did not provide a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/brown-mit-shootings-may-have-stemmed-from-suspects-failures-fixation-scientists-success-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motive for shooting students</a> at Brown or for killing the MIT professor, Nuno Loureiro, 47.

I’m in a storage space in Salem, I’ve had this here for three years, I think. I still have money. … I am not going to apologize, because during my lifetime no one sincerely apologized to me." He also rejected that mental illness was to blame, saying: "that’s all bull---- excuses."</p><p>"I am – I am sane," he said. "I’ve always been, more or less [sane]."</p><p>Neves Valente also said President Donald Trump was right to "have called me an animal, which is true."</p><p>"I am an animal, and he is also, but uhm, I have no love–I have no hatred towards America, I also have no hatred at all.
