<p>Crowded cabins and forced small talk have long defined ride-sharing. A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California startup</a> wants to flip that idea on its head. </p><p>Pliyt believes the future of ride-sharing means sharing the ride as little as possible. Instead of one shared cabin, its autonomous vehicle concept divides the interior into four fully independent pods. Each one acts like a private room on wheels. </p><p>The goal is simple. Get you from point A to point B without invading your <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal space</a>.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

Each passenger rides inside a self-contained capsule that prioritizes privacy, comfort and control. The company says the idea resonated strongly when the prototype debuted at CES earlier this month. Here is what sets the concept apart:</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blue-city-riders-hit-priciest-uber-fares-la-nyc-costs-soar-past-comparable-metros-data-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BLUE-CITY RIDERS HIT WITH PRICIEST UBER FARES AS LA, NYC COSTS SOAR PAST COMPARABLE METROS, DATA SHOWS</strong></a></p><p>You decide how social or private your ride feels. Traveling with a companion? The divider between pods can be lowered so you can share the space by choice. </p><p>"We believe rider choice and personal space will be foundational to the future of shared autonomous mobility," the company told CyberGuy. "As vehicles become autonomous, differentiation will shift from driving to experience. Giving riders control over privacy, comfort, and interaction, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all shared cabin, will be critical for trust and adoption, especially in dense urban environments. Shared mobility doesn't have to mean shared personal space, and we see that as a key evolution of the category."</p><p>Yes. Pliyt vehicles are designed to operate without human drivers. However, the company does not plan to build its own autonomous driving system. Instead, Pliyt intends to partner with established autonomy providers once development progresses.</p><p>"Our current plan is to launch an initial service in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/san-francisco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco</a> around 2028, beginning with controlled, geo-fenced deployments and expanding gradually as autonomy, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks mature," a spokesperson for Pliyt told CyberGuy. "Our focus today is on building the right vehicle architecture, partnerships, and user experience to support that rollout responsibly."</p><p>Privacy sits at the center of Pliyt's design philosophy. Every pod is built for in-ride anonymity even during shared trips. Fellow passengers cannot see you, and you cannot see them unless you choose to. This approach stands out in a world where many mobility platforms depend on data collection and shared environments. Pliyt positions privacy as foundational rather than optional. The company says no personal identities are visible during rides. The experience aims to feel calm, intentional and free from observation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/can-autonomous-trucks-really-make-highways-safer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?</strong></a></p><p>Pliyt also leans heavily into comfort. Seats feature what the company calls <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/attributes/innovations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zero-gravity positioning</a>. You will not float like an astronaut, but the posture is designed to reduce pressure and fatigue. Large windows offer panoramic city views while still maintaining privacy. Personal lighting and climate controls help tailor the ride to your preferences. If relaxing is not your goal, productivity comes built in. The retractable workstation allows you to work, review documents or create content while moving through the city.</p><p>Autonomous pods are not entirely new. Companies like Zoox and Waymo already operate self-driving vehicles with unique interiors. Waymo's Zeekr RT, for example, focuses on spacious seating and rider comfort. Pliyt's difference lies in isolation by design. Instead of rethinking a shared cabin, it breaks the vehicle into four private spaces. The result feels closer to a personal lounge than a ride-share.</p><p>If this concept becomes reality, ride-sharing could feel very different. No forced conversations. No shared armrests. No feeling watched. For commuters, it could mean working quietly on the way to the office. For travelers, it could mean relaxing without distractions. For introverts, it could mean finally enjoying shared mobility on their own terms. It also raises bigger questions about how future cities balance efficiency with dignity and personal space.</p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?

A calmer, more respectful way to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move through cities</a>. Whether the concept scales will depend on partnerships, regulation and public adoption. Still, the idea challenges long-standing assumptions about what ride-sharing has to feel like. If autonomous vehicles are coming either way, designs like this suggest they do not have to feel crowded or impersonal.</p><p>Would you choose a shared ride that feels completely private, or does part of you still want the human element along the way?
