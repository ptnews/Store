<p>The Trump administration is suing Virginia over a law that allows some <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal immigrants</a> to pay in-state tuition rates to attend universities and colleges.</p><p>Federal law prohibits states from providing illegal immigrants postsecondary education benefits that are denied to U.S. citizens. </p><p>The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in Richmond, argues that Virginia state law discriminates against American citizens who can’t afford the same reduced tuition rates, scholarships or subsidies and that it incentivizes illegal immigration. </p><p>"This is not only wrong but illegal. The challenged act’s discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over citizens is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law," the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.587797/gov.uscourts.vaed.587797.1.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">13-page complaint</a> states. "There are no exceptions.

"This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the office of Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares for comment. </p><p>The Trump administration has filed tuition lawsuits against several other states, including Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California. </p><p>Upon taking office, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders to ensure illegal immigrants can't obtain <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/immigrant-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taxpayer benefits</a> or preferential treatment.</p>
