<p>The ruling Ayatollah of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ali Khamenei, on Saturday issued an angry response to the unfolding nationwide demonstrations against his regime’s political and economic corruption.</p><p>The 86-year-old Khamenei, in his first public speech since the strikes and social unrest rocked his fragile regime seven days ago declared, "A number of agitated people, enemy mercenaries, had positioned themselves behind bazaar merchants and chanted slogans against Islam, against Iran and against the Islamic Republic.</p><p>"Protest is legitimate, but protest is different from rioting." He warned that "officials should speak with protesters. Speaking with a rioter is pointless. Rioters must be put in their place."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-protests-turn-deadly-anti-regime-demonstrations-enter-fifth-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN PROTESTS TURN DEADLY AS ANTI-REGIME DEMONSTRATIONS ENTER FIFTH DAY</strong></a></p><p>Khamenei’s branding of the pro-democracy activists as "rioters" follows <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-us-intervene-iran-starts-killing-protesters-locked-loaded" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Trump’s unprecedented message</a> of solidarity to the demonstrators on Friday. </p><p>"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.

They have only one message for him: pack up his rule and remove his scourge from the Iranian people. Better still if he comes to his senses and leaves of his own accord. Khamenei must know that threats, bluster, and repression cannot stop the uprising.

Khamenei: We, the people of Iran, will pull you down from your teetering perch like Zahhak the despot and will free our beloved Iran from you and your regime.</p><p>"To the military and law enforcement forces: do not tie your fate to the sinking ship of the Islamic Republic. Join the people and separate yourselves from this <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/corruption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corrupt system</a>. Your weapons are for defending the nation, not suppressing it. Those who fire bullets at the people should be certain that they will be identified and punished. Fellow countrymen: do not abandon the streets; increase your presence. The world sees your resistance and bravery and supports you."</p>
