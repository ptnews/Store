<p>Nick Kyrgios defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the latest <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Battle of the Sexes"</a> tennis match on Sunday, but tennis fans found fault with the event for several reasons.</p><p>The "Battle of the Sexes" name was borrowed from the historic 1973 match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. King won the match in four straight sets and helped launch efforts to start a female tour and get equal pay in tennis.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>The Kyrgios-Sabalenka match didn’t appear to have the same cultural significance.
