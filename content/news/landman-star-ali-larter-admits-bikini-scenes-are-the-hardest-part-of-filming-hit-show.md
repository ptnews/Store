<p>Ali Larter admitted that her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/landman-star-ali-larter-reveals-430-a-m-workout-routine-diet-secrets-paramount-role" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bikini scenes </a>in "Landman" are the most challenging for her to film. </p><p>During an interview with People magazine, the 49-year-old actress, who plays Angela Norris in the hit Paramount+ series, described shooting scenes in which her character wears a bikini as "tough, in a weird way."</p><p>"I don't think there's an actress alive that's like, 'Woo! Got a bikini scene!' " Larter said. "Nobody wants to do it."</p><p>"Those are the hardest for me," she continued. "I don't enjoy them. It's just part of the story that I'm telling, and I'm an actress, so I get on board. But those are definitely my least favorite."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/landman-star-ali-larter-escaped-idaho-after-hollywoods-many-social-demands" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'LANDMAN' STAR ALI LARTER ESCAPED TO IDAHO AFTER HOLLYWOOD'S 'MANY' SOCIAL DEMANDS</strong></a></p><p>Angela is the confident and glamorous ex-wife of Billy Bob Thornton's Tommy Norris. The "Varsity Blues" star noted that her character is "so physical and loves the spray tans, and the blonde." </p><p>Larter explained that portraying Angela, who is often clad in revealing clothing, requires effort and discipline to ensure that she is "staying in shape for this role and all that comes with it."</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://people.com/ali-larter-spills-her-fitness-secrets-exclusive-11845316" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>People</u></a> in November, Larter shared how she adheres to a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/landman-star-ali-larter-reveals-430-a-m-workout-routine-diet-secrets-paramount-role" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strict diet and fitness routine</a> while filming the show.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/billy-bob-thornton-blasts-landman-exit-rumors-a-i-generated-crap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILLY BOB THORNTON BLASTS ‘LANDMAN’ EXIT RUMORS AS ‘A.I.-GENERATED CRAP'</strong></a></p><p>"I'll tell you what. I work really hard, OK? I'm not pretending that I don't," she said. "I'm up at 4:30 [a.m.] on Mondays. I go for a run. It's only 30 minutes. I try to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eat very clean</a>, but I eat. I'm one of those protein mommies. I eat so much protein all day long. It works for me."</p><p>She explained that, in addition to running, she also does "a lot of strength training."</p><p>"In the end, anytime you have to put on a bathing suit and walk in front of anybody, it's really difficult," she said. "When I look around, the sexiest women I know are the women that own it. So, part of getting there with Angela is owning it."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ali-larter-leaves-little-imagination-sheer-burgundy-outfit-london-landman-premiere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ALI LARTER LEAVES LITTLE TO IMAGINATION IN SHEER BURGUNDY OUTFIT AT LONDON 'LANDMAN' PREMIERE</strong></a></p><p>"But no matter what, it's like, I've got to spend all this time fighting off my own insecurities, my own anxiety, to be able to put on that bikini and walk into these scenes," she admitted.</p><p>Larter told People that "there is no space in my mind for insecurity" when playing Angela.</p><p>"I wouldn't be able to do it if I allowed insecurity to creep in," she said. "And I really do believe, sexiness — yeah, she's sexy on the outside, but guess what? She's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">owning it on the inside</a>, too."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/paramounts-landman-tackles-woke-roommate-culture-safe-space-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PARAMOUNT'S ‘LANDMAN’ TACKLES WOKE ROOMMATE CULTURE AND SAFE-SPACE POLITICS</strong></a></p><p>When she isn't busy filming "Landman," Larter told People she is sleeping in and spending time with her family.</p><p>"I fall apart on the weekends.
