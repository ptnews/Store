<p>As Americans tighten their wallets, consumers are cutting back on some everyday luxuries — but not coffee.</p><p>A Dec. 18 report from Placer.ai, an analytics platform, found that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffee chains</a> recorded year-over-year visit growth in 2025, even as restaurants struggled to achieve the same success.</p><p>The report mentions Scooter's Coffee, a drive-thru coffee chain headquartered in Nebraska, noting the chain saw a 3.1% year-over-year increase in average visits per location in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/americas-best-coffee-isnt-cafes-anymore-its-showing-up-gas-stations"><strong><u>AMERICA'S BEST COFFEE ISN'T IN CAFES ANYMORE; IT'S SHOWING UP AT GAS STATIONS</u></strong></a></p><p>Also noted in the report: Nearly one in four customers of Aroma Joe's, a New England-based chain, visited at least four times in October 2025 — a sign of high loyalty.</p><p>The reason for coffee chains' success? It comes down to affordable indulgences, Placer.ai found. </p><p>Americans may be packing lunches for work and cutting back on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/dinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expensive dinners,</a> but a small or medium cup of coffee — rarely priced above $10 in most parts of the country — remains a feasible, everyday treat to many people.</p><p>Part of it is regional. The report found coffee chains are moving toward underserved regions, such as the Southeast, Sun Belt and Texas.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"[In] these regions where branded coffee still represents a relatively small share of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dining visits,</a>" the report said, "operators across dining segments can learn from coffee's approach and identify markets with low category penetration to lean into those whitespace opportunities."</p><p>Many coffee chains have also delved into pop culture collaborations — which Placer.ai said drove growth.</p><p>The firm cited Dunkin's limited-time <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Wicked" collaboration</a> as an effort that "generated a significant multi-day traffic spike."</p><p>"Dunkin's 'Wicked' surge shows that when executed well, cultural relevance can also significantly move the needle," the report stated.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Other dining segments may also lean into thoughtful collabs to create outsized excitement and traffic lift — even without deep discounts or free offers."</p><p>The report suggested that dining chains take a lesson from coffee places, saying that the sector's 2025 performance "offers a blueprint for dining success."</p><p>"Chains are expanding smartly into underpenetrated regions, successfully implementing both hyper-efficient and hyper-personal service models, using recurring [limited-time offers] to build seasonal and monthly rituals, and leveraging <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2025-most-memorable-pop-culture-moments-december-27-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merch and pop culture</a> partnerships to reshape demand."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the National Restaurant Association for comment.</p><p>Alex Tchekmeian, the Florida-based founder and president of Foxtail Coffee, told Fox News Digital he wasn't surprised by the report.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">His chain</a> is expanding across multiple states, including Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Virginia and Nevada. </p><p>"Overall, coffee has generally held up better than many other dining categories as consumers tighten their spending, and we expect that resilience to continue into 2026," Tchekmeian said.</p><p>"National industry data show coffee's broad appeal and steady consumption patterns, supported by a large and loyal base of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regular drinkers</a> who often prioritize that daily ritual even in tighter economic times."</p>
