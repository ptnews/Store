<p>Minneapolis-area leaders on Tuesday formally denounced federal immigration authorities and called for their removal from the region amid the Trump administration's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/deportation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deportation campaign</a>. </p><p>The Hennepin County Administration, Operations and Budget Committee unanimously passed a resolution condemning ICE and calling for the removal of ICE personnel and assets from Minnesota.</p><p>In a statement, the seven-member committee said it did "not take this action lightly."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minnesota-lawsuit-trumps-ice-invasion-wont-succeed-legal-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MINNESOTA LAWSUIT OVER TRUMP'S ICE 'INVASION' WON'T SUCCEED: LEGAL EXPERT</u></strong></a></p><p>"It comes forward in the context of an additional 1,000 ICE agents due to arrive in the metro area during the largest deployment of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DHS resources</a> in our nation's history, anywhere," committee Vice Chair Debbie Goettel said. </p><p>The committee framed the vote as a stand to protect residents. The board will vote to formally adopt the resolution in its Jan. 27 meeting. </p><p>"We stand with our immigrant communities, our protesters and observers, and our neighbors standing together to bring accountability to this unconscionable show of force," Goettel said. </p><p>The vote came hours after President Donald Trump said his administration will withhold <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cut-federal-payments-sanctuary-cities-starting-feb-1-over-immigration-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal payments</a> from sanctuary jurisdictions beginning Feb. 1. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republican-calls-hearing-after-deadly-ice-shooting-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>HOUSE REPUBLICAN CALLS FOR HEARING AFTER DEADLY ICE SHOOTING IN MINNEAPOLIS</u></strong></a></p><p>In a Truth Social post, Trump said sanctuary cities hamper federal immigration enforcement efforts at the expense of public safety. </p><p>"And it breeds fraud and crime and all the other problems that come. So we’re not making any payment to anybody that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/sanctuary-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports sanctuary</a>," Trump wrote. </p><p>Earlier in the week, the Department of Homeland Security said it would be sending additional federal agents to protect Minnesota immigration officers as they conduct enforcement operations while facing protesters. </p><p>Minnesota has become a flashpoint in Trump's deportation campaign following last week's fatal shooting of Renee Good, who was shot by an ICE agent as she attempted to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ram into him</a> with her vehicle, officials said. </p><p>The city of Minneapolis is suing the federal government over the law enforcement operations, which local officials said have been marked by racial profiling and excessive force. </p>
