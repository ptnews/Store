<p>A simple blood test may detect <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health/crohns-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crohn’s disease</a> years before symptoms appear, according to a new study reported by SWNS.</p><p>Canadian researchers say the discovery could enable earlier diagnosis and potential prevention of the chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><p>The test measures the immune system’s response to flagellin, a protein found in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/bacteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gut bacteria</a>. Researchers found that this response is elevated in some people years before Crohn’s develops.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/doctor-warns-simple-food-mistakes-increase-chronic-disease-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOCTOR WARNS OF 2 SIMPLE FOOD MISTAKES THAT INCREASE CHRONIC DISEASE RISK</strong></a></p><p>The findings, published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, highlight the "interplay" between gut bacteria and immune system responses as a key step in the disease’s development, per the SWNS report.</p><p>Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gastrointestinal tract</a> that causes persistent digestive symptoms, pain and fatigue, significantly affecting quality of life. Its incidence among children has doubled since 1995, according to official figures.</p><p>The presence of flagellin antibodies long before symptoms appear suggests that the immune reaction may help trigger the disease, according to research leader Dr. Ken Croitoru, clinician-scientist and professor of medicine and immunology at the University of Toronto. </p><p>A better understanding of this early process could lead to improved prediction, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevention and treatment</a>, the expert said.</p><p>"With all the advanced biologic therapy we have today, patients’ responses are partial at best," Croitoru told SWNS. "We haven’t cured anybody yet, and we need to do better."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/misunderstood-illness-leaves-millions-exhausted-most-cases-undiagnosed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MISUNDERSTOOD ILLNESS LEAVES MILLIONS EXHAUSTED, WITH MOST CASES UNDIAGNOSED</strong></a></p><p>"We wanted to know: Do people who are at risk, who are healthy now, have these antibodies against flagellin?" he said. "We looked, we measured, and yes indeed, at least some of them did."</p><p>This new research is part of the Genetic, Environmental and Microbial (GEM) Project, which has followed more than 5,000 healthy first-degree relatives of people with Crohn’s disease worldwide since 2008. The project <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collects genetic</a>, biological and environmental data to better understand how the disease develops.</p><p>The study followed 381 first-degree relatives of Crohn’s patients, 77 of whom later developed the disease. Of those, more than 30% had elevated antibody responses.</p><p>The responses were strongest in siblings, underscoring the role of shared environmental exposure, researchers said.</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>So far, 130 of the study participants have developed Crohn’s, giving researchers a rare opportunity to study its earliest stages. The average time from blood sample collection to diagnosis was nearly 2-½ years.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Previous GEM research showed that an inflammatory <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune response</a> targeting gut bacteria can appear long before the disease develops. </p><p>In healthy people, gut bacteria coexist peacefully and play an essential role in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digestive health</a> — but in Crohn’s patients, the immune system appears to mount an abnormal response against the microbes, experts say.</p><p>The Canadian team also confirmed that this pre-disease immune response was associated with intestinal inflammation and gut barrier dysfunction, both hallmarks of Crohn’s disease. </p><p>Research team member Dr. Sun-Ho Lee, a gastroenterologist, commented that this new study supports the idea of designing a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flagellin-directed vaccine</a> for certain high-risk individuals to prevent the disease, according to SWNS.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>The study did have some limitations, including that it did not include experiments to show exactly how the immune response might lead to Crohn’s disease. </p><p>As a result, the researchers could not determine the biological steps linking the immune reaction to the onset of the illness. "Further validation and mechanistic studies are underway," they noted.</p>
