Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. They should be grateful also," Trump said during the forum in Davos.</p><p>"But they're not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful. They should be grateful to us, Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," he said, referring to remarks Carney made earlier this week.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/us-trade-rep-shrugs-off-world-leaders-swipes-trump-amid-davos-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US TRADE REP SHRUGS OFF WORLD LEADERS’ SWIPES AT TRUMP AMID DAVOS BACKLASH</strong></a></p><p>While Carney did not mention Trump by name, he warned in his remarks that the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/geopolitics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rules-based international order</a> is breaking down as "great powers" increasingly wield economic and security leverage to coerce allies.</p><p>The prime minister argued that "middle powers" like Canada must heed the "wake-up call" that compliance does not guarantee safety, urging instead a strategy focused on diversification, collective action and respect for sovereignty.</p><p>Trump said he will chair <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/countries-signed-trumps-gaza-board-peace-charter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new peace board</a>, which will also feature senior political, diplomatic and business figures, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a>, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and billionaire Marc Rowan.</p><p>The president has invited Russia, Belarus, France, Germany, Vietnam, Finland, Ukraine, Ireland, Greece, Israel and China, to join the board.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Ashley Carnahan contributed to this report.</i></p>
