<p>The president is pitching blood for oil in Venezuela. It's a dangerous mission, a corrupt deal and a lawless precedent. Congress must stop this recklessness before it costs the lives of American troops.  </p><p>One of us is a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/marines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressman who commanded Marines</a> in jungle training in Latin America. The other is a state representative and candidate for the U.S. Senate out of Texas, the biggest oil producer in the country. We’re both members of Majority Democrats, a group of elected leaders dedicated to rebuilding trust with the exhausted majority of Americans. Whether seen from the perspective of the military or the Texas middle class, we agree: Republicans in Congress are failing to provide a check and balance on warmongering. </p><p>The president’s strikes against Venezuela have left in place the gangsters running the country, but put them on notice that their oil is now his. To take it, President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> has made clear that he wants U.S. oil majors to start rebuilding Venezuela's derelict energy infrastructure. That's expensive and hazardous. </p><p>Chevron and the rest will want serious support from the U.S. government. For starters, their personnel and assets require security. Pro-Chavismo Venezuelan forces, leftist Colombian terrorists and transnational criminal organizations are all threats. This is why the president refused to rule out <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American boots on the ground</a>. He may need troops to serve as armed guards for oil extraction.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marco-rubio-emerges-key-trump-power-player-after-venezuela-operation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MARCO RUBIO EMERGES AS KEY TRUMP POWER PLAYER AFTER VENEZUELA OPERATION</strong></a></p><p>The enemies awaiting Americans deployed to Venezuela have spent their whole lives traversing its jungles and rivers. The U.S. military, by contrast, has trained two generations in patrolling and close-air-support that presumes long line of sight, not dense canopy. Jungle warfare would be a new and nasty mission. </p><p>Make no mistake: our Marines, soldiers and sailors would complete that mission. They are the finest fighting force in the world. But they would be fighting for oil money for the rich – not for democracy, drug interdiction, or a better future for Venezuelans. Hit by raids, cut off from fire support, infected by malaria — all in the service of crony capitalism. </p><p>Last year, Trump promised oil executives "a great deal" if they donated $1 billion to his campaign. He is now offering them 300 billion barrels of oil. It won't make gas any cheaper for Americans this decade. Projections for 500,000 extra daily barrels would not make a price dent in a market where 100+ million barrels are sold daily. It also won't bring jobs to Texas, where Chevron just laid off 200 workers in Midland.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</strong></a></p><p>Chevron executives and other administration allies, though, stand to gain power and wealth from controlling the world's largest oil reserve. As with tariffs, AI and his tax cuts for the wealthy, the president is once again pursuing policies that further consolidate wealth and power. </p><p>He's also, once again, breaking the law. The attacks on Venezuela are illegal. The president claims he is only using the military to support <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-rip-senate-war-powers-push-political-theater-after-trumps-venezuela-raid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law enforcement in executing an indictment</a>. Hard to take that claim seriously from a man who had U.S. soldiers on their knees to roll out a red carpet for the war criminal Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.</p><p>Apart from its risibility, though, the claim is bogus. Absent an imminent threat to the homeland, the president needs <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional authorization</a> to use military force. There is no threat from Venezuela too pressing or existential to deliberate upon in Congress. If the president were concerned about drugs (He's not.), he could get tough on Chinese fentanyl exports (He hasn't.).  </p><p>Neither party should accept the precedent that a commander-in-chief can bomb cities and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-dem-introduces-bill-venezuela-operation-block-presidents-bypassing-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capture foreign leaders without so much</a> as a phone call to Congress. It's a recipe for more military adventurism, more blood and treasure sunk by poor planning. Indeed, the president is already jawboning about Cuba, Greenland and Colombia. Republicans in Congress must stop acting like sheep. Neither our military nor our economy would benefit from open-ended deployment to Venezuela. </p><p><i>Democrat Jake Auchincloss represents the Massachusetts Fourth Congressional District in Congress where he is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.</i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/a/rep-jake-auchincloss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JAKE AUCHINCLOSS</u></strong></a></p>
