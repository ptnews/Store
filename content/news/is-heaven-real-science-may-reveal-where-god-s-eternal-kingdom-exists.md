<p>When our son was 4 years old, he asked my wife and me: "Can you drive to heaven?" Out of the mouth of babes, right?</p><p>It’s a question only a child would ask, but it raises a very adult question: Where exactly is the heaven described in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bible</a>?</p><p>As a scientist, I understand the importance of definitions. According to the Bible, the lowest level of heaven is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earth’s atmosphere</a>. The mid-level heaven is outer space. The highest-level heaven is what we’re talking about: It’s where God dwells.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dan-gainor-meeting-man-who-brought-final-frontier-our-living-rooms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DAN GAINOR: MEETING THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THE FINAL FRONTIER INTO OUR LIVING ROOMS</strong></a></p><p>As for heaven’s location, the Bible contains many verses that describe us as looking "up" at God in heaven, and God as looking "down" at us on Earth.</p><p>Imagine boarding a nuclear-powered rocket and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/spaceflight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traveling straight "up" into deep space</a>. Will you ever reach a point far enough "up" into space that you finally reach heaven?</p><p>Before you laugh off the idea, consider this.</p><p>In 1929, American attorney-turned-amateur astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are rushing away from one another like so much shrapnel from a bomb. Hubble also discovered there’s a definite pattern to how galaxies are rushing away from each other, namely: The farther "up" in space a galaxy is located — the farther away it is from Earth — the faster it’s moving away from Earth and everything else. It’s called <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/astronomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubble’s Law</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bishop-robert-barron-mysterious-fourth-christmas-story-heaven-battling-evil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BISHOP ROBERT BARRON: THE MYSTERIOUS FOURTH CHRISTMAS STORY OF HEAVEN BATTLING EVIL</strong></a></p><p>But, here’s where it gets really interesting.</p><p>Theoretically, a galaxy that’s 273 billion trillion (273,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from Earth would move at 186,000 miles per second, which is the speed of light. That distance, way "up" there in space, is called the Cosmic Horizon.</p><p>That means you and I can never reach the Cosmic Horizon — not even aboard the most souped-up, nuclear-powered rocket imaginable — because, as Einstein explained in his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science/physics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">theory of special relativity</a>, only light and certain other non-material phenomena can travel at the speed of light.</p><p>So, then, where is heaven located, exactly? It’s entirely possible heaven is located on the other side of the Cosmic Horizon. Here’s why.</p><p>One: According to modern cosmology, an entire universe exists beyond the Cosmic Horizon. But it’s permanently hidden from us because we can never reach, let alone cross over, the Cosmic Horizon.</p><p>Two: Our best astronomical observations — and Einstein’s theories of special and general relativity — indicate that time stops at the Cosmic Horizon. At that special distance, way "up" there in deep, deep, deep space, there is no past, present or future. There’s only timelessness.</p><p>Three: Unlike time, however, space does exist at and beyond the Cosmic Horizon. Which means the hidden universe beyond the Cosmic Horizon is habitable, albeit only by light and light-like entities.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</u></strong></a></p><p>Four: According to modern cosmology, the Cosmic Horizon is lined with the very oldest celestial objects in the observable universe. That means whatever exists beyond the Cosmic Horizon predates these oldest objects… predates the so-called big bang… predates the beginning of the observable universe.</p><p>All these modern scientific realities, and others, are why it’s entirely reasonable to speculate that:</p><p>1. Heaven is, indeed, located "up" there — way above our heads and way beyond the visible, starlit universe — just as the Bible indicates.</p><p>2. Heaven is inaccessible to us mortals while we’re alive, just as the Bible indicates.</p><p>3. Heaven is inhabited by nonmaterial, timeless beings, just as the Bible indicates.</p><p>4. Heaven is the dwelling place of the One who predates the universe — the One who created the universe — just as the Bible indicates.</p>
