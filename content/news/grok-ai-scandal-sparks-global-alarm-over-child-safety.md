<p>Grok, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in chatbot on X,</a> is facing intense scrutiny after acknowledging it generated and shared an AI image depicting two young girls in sexualized attire.</p><p>In a public post on X, Grok admitted the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content "violated ethical standards"</a> and "potentially U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM)." The chatbot added, "It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues."</p><p>That admission alone is alarming. What followed revealed a far broader pattern.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong></p><p>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.</p><p>Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.</p><p>After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.</p><p>Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, "When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal<strong>."</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/protecting-kids-from-ai-chatbots-what-guard-act-means" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS</strong></a></p><p>This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.</p><p>In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.</p><p>A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.</p><p>The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress, Nell Fisher, from the Netflix series Stranger Things. Grok later admitted there were isolated cases where users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.</p><p>The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/leaked-meta-documents-show-how-ai-chatbots-handle-child-exploitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LEAKED META DOCUMENTS SHOW HOW AI CHATBOTS HANDLE CHILD EXPLOITATION</strong></a></p><p>The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.</p><p>Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.</p><p>Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?</p><p>If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children.</p><p>Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.</p><p>Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.</p><p>Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.</p><p><strong>Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?</strong></p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?

When safeguards fail, real people suffer and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.</p><p>Should any AI system be approved for government or mass public use before it proves it can reliably protect children and prevent abuse?
