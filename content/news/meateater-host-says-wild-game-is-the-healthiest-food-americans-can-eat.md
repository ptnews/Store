<p>As Americans continue to debate diets, calories and protein sources, Steven Rinella of Montana has a simpler definition of healthy eating: Go outside and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get your food.</a></p><p>"The act of going and getting it is time spent outdoors," the cookbook author and host of the hunting show "MeatEater" told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview.</p><p>"It's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/real-estate/outdoor-living" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time spent outdoors</a> being physically active. Just the pursuit of the ingredients is some of the best exercise you can get."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/cowboy-chef-says-americans-turning-one-healthiest-meats-most-grocery-stores" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COWBOY CHEF SAYS AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO ONE OF THE 'HEALTHIEST MEATS,' AND IT'S AT MOST GROCERY STORES</strong></a></p><p>That philosophy is at the center of a new boxed set that brings together two of Rinella's most <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/cookbooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular cookbooks</a>, "The MeatEater Fish and Game Cookbook" and "The MeatEater Outdoor Cookbook."</p><p>He believes <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food, fitness and time outdoors</a> are very much connected — whether meals are prepared in a home kitchen, over a backyard grill or at a remote campsite.</p><p>Rinella said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild game</a>, although it isn't necessarily labeled as health food, may be the most natural form of clean eating available.</p><p>"I'd say it's the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthiest food,</a>" he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/skip-multivitamin-5-nutrient-rich-foods-recommended-doctors-instead" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SKIP THE MULTIVITAMIN: 5 NUTRIENT-RICH FOODS RECOMMENDED BY DOCTORS INSTEAD</strong></a></p><p>Wild game "has powered human beings for tens of thousands of years," Rinella noted with a smile. </p><p>"I did not invent this," he added.</p><p>It's important that those eating game meat be sure to cook it at a safe temperature to prevent foodborne illness. </p><p>Guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) call for an internal temperature of at least 145° Fahrenheit for bison, veal, goat, lamb or seafood, 160° Fahrenheit for bear meat, and 165° Fahrenheit for poultry.</p><p>Unlike conventional store-bought meat, wild game is naturally lean and fully traceable, Rinella said. In his household, that transparency is intentional, he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/americas-cast-iron-cowboy-reveals-why-traditional-skillets-remain-ultimate-cooking-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AMERICA'S 'CAST IRON COWBOY' REVEALS WHY TRADITIONAL SKILLETS REMAIN THE ULTIMATE COOKING TOOL</strong></a></p><p>"When we eat, we eat stuff where you look, and you can tell where it came from — that it grew out of the ground, that it came off an animal," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/hunting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hunting and fishing</a>, he said, bring built-in physical activity and time outdoors, elements he sees as essential to health.</p><p>"Getting our ingredients involves rigorous exercise and time outside," Rinella said.
