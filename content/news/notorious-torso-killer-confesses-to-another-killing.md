While nothing can undo this loss, we hope that today finally brings some measure of peace to those who have carried this pain for so long," the department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FairLawnPD/posts/pfbid02221iJEJpC2snhxzpd3ry1hGQkPinHoFVmKFMzJQ7mLCcGAzGcRKgeNUJvZ3cL1ACl?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZYCNW56uiq2zqbCloj7cPwq3jHRr0Vrwx17svyp8KKB36wnLNEnc5RYzR6JvBIvrf-n-RiJIC1slZxgQTV4jQKjKSEwIWjaLX-levPWNE37gTF77um4iZB9JuD2t6Z9IA4hUKfkop3qrAXmf5q7AxOxOM31aKXFbBMWGhSVwpVbcQ&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote on Facebook</a>.</p><p>Eberhardt was found dead in her family's home at the age of 18 in Fair Lawn, N.J., a suburb just outside of Manhattan.</p><p>Richard Cottingham, known as the "Torso Killer," confessed to the murder, giving police details "that were never publicly known," the department said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-hampshire-cold-case-solved-50-years-after-fbi-forensic-lab-report-let-killer-escape-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW HAMPSHIRE COLD CASE SOLVED 50 YEARS AFTER FBI FORENSIC LAB REPORT LET KILLER ESCAPE JUSTICE</strong></a></p><p>"After the case was reopened in 2021, Fair Lawn detectives worked tirelessly to re-examine the investigation," police said. "Over the course of several years, and through countless interviews and persistent effort, Richard Cottingham ultimately provided a full confession, including details that were never publicly known."</p><p>Fair Lawn Police Chief Joseph Dawicki memorialized Eberhardt in a statement, saying she was a "vibrant young nursing student who was taken from our community far too soon."</p><p>"While we can never bring her back, I am hopeful that her family can find some peace knowing the person responsible has confessed and can no longer harm anyone else," Dawicki added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-cold-case-breakthroughs-sheriffs-unit-cracks-two-long-unsolved-killings-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FLORIDA COLD CASE BREAKTHROUGHS: SHERIFF’S UNIT CRACKS TWO LONG-UNSOLVED KILLINGS</strong></a></p><p>Michael Smith, who was identified by several news outlets as Eberhardt's nephew, responded to the Fair Lawn Police Department's post with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FairLawnPD/posts/pfbid02221iJEJpC2snhxzpd3ry1hGQkPinHoFVmKFMzJQ7mLCcGAzGcRKgeNUJvZ3cL1ACl?comment_id=2154870855270429&amp;__cft__%5B0%5D=AZYCNW56uiq2zqbCloj7cPwq3jHRr0Vrwx17svyp8KKB36wnLNEnc5RYzR6JvBIvrf-n-RiJIC1slZxgQTV4jQKjKSEwIWjaLX-levPWNE37gTF77um4iZB9JuD2t6Z9IA4hUKfkop3qrAXmf5q7AxOxOM31aKXFbBMWGhSVwpVbcQ&amp;__tn__=R%5D-R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement from the family.</a> In the statement, Smith wrote about the important closure that the development has brought his family and thanked the Fair Lawn Police Department for its work on the case.</p><p>"Our family has waited since 1965 for the truth.
