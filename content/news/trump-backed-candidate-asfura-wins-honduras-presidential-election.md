<p>Nasry Asfura has won the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 Honduras presidential election,</a> delivering victory for the right-of-center National Party of Honduras (PNH) and shifting the political landscape of Central America. </p><p>The 40.3% to 39.5% result in favor of Asfura over Liberal Party candidate Salvador Nasralla arrived after the vote-counting process had been delayed for days by technical glitches and claims by other candidates of vote-rigging. Rixi Moncada, the candidate of the ruling LIBRE party, came in a distant third.</p><p>The results of the race were so tight and the ballot processing system was so chaotic, that about 15% of the tally sheets, which accounted for hundreds of thousands of ballots, had to be counted by hand to determine the winner.</p><p>Two electoral council members and one deputy approved the results despite disputes over the razor-thin difference in the vote. A third council member, Marlon Ocha, was not in a video declaring the winner.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-plans-full-complete-pardon-former-honduran-president-convicted-drug-trafficking" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP PLANS 'FULL AND COMPLETE PARDON' FOR FORMER HONDURAN PRESIDENT CONVICTED OF DRUG TRAFFICKING</strong></a></p><p>"Honduras: I am ready to govern.
