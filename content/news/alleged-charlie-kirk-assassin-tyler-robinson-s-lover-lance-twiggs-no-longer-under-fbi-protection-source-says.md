<p>PROVO, Utah – A law enforcement source confirmed to Fox News Digital that Lance Twiggs, the transgender roommate and romantic partner of Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tyler-robinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Robinson</a>, is no longer under FBI protection.</p><p>Twiggs has not been charged with any crime. The FBI has not publicly explained why his protection ended.</p><p>A relative previously told Fox News Digital that Twiggs moved into a townhome in St. George, Utah, after living with his grandparents when his father kicked him out. The 22-year-old was in the process of transitioning from male to female at the time, the relative said. He was kicked out of his parents’ home at age 18, according to the relative.</p><p>The relative said Twiggs struggled with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drug and alcohol abuse</a>, was addicted to video games, and was grappling with his gender identity, adding that those issues fueled repeated conflicts with family members.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/tyler-robinson-prosecutors-say-charlie-kirk-shooting-texts-show-confusion-not-bias-rebut-conflict-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TYLER ROBINSON PROSECUTORS SAY CHARLIE KIRK SHOOTING TEXTS SHOW CONFUSION, NOT BIAS, TO REBUT CONFLICT CLAIM</strong></a></p><p>"But the real reason he was acting out was because he was using drugs and alcohol, and was addicted to gaming," the relative said.</p><p>She added that Twiggs would often present himself as reformed despite ongoing issues.</p><p>"He had always tried to put on the act that he had changed," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/accused-charlie-kirk-assassin-wants-ditch-jail-clothes-upcoming-court-appearances" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ACCUSED CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSIN WANTS TO DITCH JAIL CLOTHES FOR UPCOMING COURT APPEARANCES</strong></a></p><p>According to the relative, Twiggs initially moved into the townhome with multiple college roommates and paid full rent while maintaining employment.</p><p>"He was maintaining a job and able to pay rent, and was technically an adult," she said.</p><p>The other roommates eventually moved out, and Robinson later moved in. The two entered a romantic relationship, according to the relative, and lived together until Robinson’s arrest.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/charlie-kirks-widow-fights-keep-news-cameras-courtroom-accused-assassins-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CHARLIE KIRK'S WIDOW FIGHTS TO KEEP NEWS CAMERAS IN COURTROOM FOR ACCUSED ASSASSIN'S TRIAL</strong></a></p><p>Robinson is accused of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/charlie-kirk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assassinating Kirk</a> during a Turning Point USA event on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, authorities said.</p><p>Court documents allege Robinson texted Twiggs shortly before the killing, asking him to "look under my keyboard." Investigators say the message referred to a handwritten note.</p><p>"I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I’m going to take it," the note read, according to authorities.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/charlie-kirk-suspected-assassin-will-not-show-face-court-key-hearing-postponed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CHARLIE KIRK'S SUSPECTED ASSASSIN WILL NOT SHOW FACE IN COURT, KEY HEARING POSTPONED</strong></a></p><p>After the shooting, prosecutors say Twiggs exchanged <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text messages</a> with Robinson, questioning whether he carried out the attack.</p><p>"You weren’t the one who did it right????" Twiggs allegedly asked.</p><p>"I am, I’m sorry," Robinson allegedly responded, according to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court filings</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/alleged-charlie-kirk-assassin-tyler-robinson-defense-could-cost-utah-taxpayers-eight-figures-experts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ALLEGED CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSIN TYLER ROBINSON'S DEFENSE COULD COST UTAH TAXPAYERS 'EIGHT FIGURES': EXPERTS</strong></a></p><p>Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, two counts of obstruction of justice, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, two counts of witness tampering, and commission of a violent offense in the presence of a child.</p><p>Officials claim Robinson told investigators he killed Kirk because he "had enough of his hatred," adding that "some hate can’t be negotiated out."</p><p>A judge is scheduled to hear arguments Friday, Jan. 16, on Robinson’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/charlie-kirk-alleged-assassin-tyler-robinson-tries-boot-prosecutors-from-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motion to remove the</a> entire Utah County Attorney’s Office from the case.
