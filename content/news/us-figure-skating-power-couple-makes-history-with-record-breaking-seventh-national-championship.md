<p>U.S. figure skating stars Madison Chock and Evan Bates made history on Saturday with their record-setting seventh U.S. Figure Skating title in their final competition before the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milan Cortina Olympics</a>.</p><p>The three-time reigning world champions, performing a flamenco-style dance to a version of the Rolling Stones hit "Paint It Black" from the dystopian sci-fi Western show "Westworld," produced a season-best free skate and finished with 228.87 points.</p><p>"The feeling that we got from the audience today was unlike anything I’ve ever felt before," Chock said.</p><p>They’ll be the heavy favorites to win gold next month in Italy.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p><p>"I felt so much love and joy," Chock continued, "and I’m so grateful for this moment."</p><p>U.S. Figure Skating will announce its selections on Sunday.</p><p>Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik were second with 213.65 points and Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko were third with 206.95, making those two pairs the likely choices to join Chock and Bates on the American squad for the upcoming Winter Games.</p><p>The men’s medals also were to be decided on Saturday, though two-time world champion Ilia Malinin had built such a lead after his short program that the self-styled "Quad God" would have to stumble mightily to miss out on a fourth consecutive title.</p><p>The U.S. also has the qualifying maximum of three men’s spots for the Winter Games, and competition is tight between second-place Tomoko Hiwatashi, fan favorite Jason Brown, Andrew Torgashev and Maxim Naumov to round out the nationals podium.</p><p>The last time Chock and Bates competed in the Olympics in 2022 in Beijing, they watched their gold initially go to an opponent who was later disqualified for doping violations.</p><p>Chock and Bates initially had to settle for team silver with their American teammates on the podium at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Team Russia and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/russian-figure-skating-phenom-kamila-valieva-learns-fate-olympics-doping-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Kamila Valieva,</u></a> who was 15 at the time, stood above them with their gold medals. </p><p>It wasn't until the end of January 2024, when the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found Valieva guilty of an anti-doping rule violation, when Chock, Bates and the U.S. were declared the rightful 2022 gold medalists. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/un-urges-countries-honor-truce-during-winter-olympics-not-deny-visas-any-nations-athletes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UN URGES COUNTRIES TO HONOR TRUCE DURING WINTER OLYMPICS, NOT DENY VISAS TO ANY NATION'S ATHLETES</strong></a></p><p>Valieva <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested positive for trimetazidine</a>, a banned substance, during an anti-doping test at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in December 2021. She was suspended for four years and stripped of all competitive results since that date.</p><p>Chock and Bates spoke about what their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/us-olympians-madison-chock-evan-bates-send-message-russian-opponent-who-cheated-steal-gold-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">message to Valieva</a> would be today during an interview at the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee media summit in October. </p><p>"It's hard to, I think, imagine what a 15-year-old has gone through and under that kind of situation," Bates said. "And I know how stressful it is, being an elite athlete as an adult, as a 36-year-old. And I think that grace should be given to humans across the board. And we can never really know the full situation, at least from our point of view. … I genuinely don't know what I would say to her."</p><p>Chock added, "I would just wish her well like as I would. I think life is short. And, at the end of the day, we're all human just going through our own human experience together. And regardless of what someone has or hasn't done and how it has affected you, I think it's important to remember we're humans as a collective, and we're all here for this, our one moment on earth, at the same time. And I just wish people to have healthy, happy lives, full of people that love them."</p><p>Chock and Bates had to wait more than two years after the initial Olympics to get their rightful gold medals, and they were finally presented with them during a ceremony at the Paris Olympics last summer.</p><p>Chock, Bates and teammates Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou were given a specialized gold medal ceremony to receive the medals in front of more than 13,000 fans. </p><p>Chock and Bates became the first ice dancers to win three consecutive <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/alyssa-liu-becomes-first-american-woman-win-figure-skating-world-championships-19-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>world championships</u></a> in nearly three decades in March when they defeated Canadian rivals Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
