<p>Director of National Intelligence (DNI) <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tulsi-gabbard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tulsi Gabbard</a> said the incident involving anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agitators who descended on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minn., is an example of what made her leave the Democratic Party.</p><p>"One of the main reasons I left the Democrat Party was because of their hostility towards God and those who have faith in or are trying to cultivate their love for God," Gabbard wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/TulsiGabbard/status/2013701775405261042" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post on X</a>. </p><p>"Those so-called 'protestors' who tried to intimidate and terrorize innocent women, children, and men in the Minneapolis church is just another example of their hostility towards God and His worshippers. Such behavior is demoniac and should be condemned by everyone, and those who took part in such intimidation tactics should be held accountable."</p><p>In October 2022, Gabbard, who had previously served as a congresswoman for Hawaii and ran for president as a Democrat, announced she was leaving the Democratic Party. At the time, <a href="https://x.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1579788950696185859" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">she denounced</a> her former party as an "elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-pastor-condemns-anti-ice-agitators-interrupted-service-shameful-unlawful" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA PASTOR CONDEMNS ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO INTERRUPTED SERVICE: ‘SHAMEFUL AND UNLAWFUL’</strong></a></p><p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/christian-leaders-demand-justice-after-anti-ice-agitators-storm-st-paul-church-unspeakably-evil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-ICE agitators stormed Cities Church</a> congregants in St. Paul, drawing widespread outrage and condemnation from Christian and political leaders.
