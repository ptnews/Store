Braun asked.</p><p>"If IU loses, I’ll send you some pork from [Fischer Farms], which is in my neck of the woods in Dubois County, plus some pies from the famous [Wicks Pies], including a sugar cream pie (an Indiana favorite). Pork and pie for bragging rights. You in?"</p><p>"Mike — I am happy to oblige and am impressed with IU’s turnaround (thanks in part to a Miami kid at QB). But I am all-in for The U," <a href="https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/2012344454892429567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeSantis responded</a>.
