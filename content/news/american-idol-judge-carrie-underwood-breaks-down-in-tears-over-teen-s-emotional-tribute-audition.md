"It was beautiful. It was what Aubreigh had gone through. Aubreigh is my forever 13-year-old daughter. She is bright, beautiful, talented, and she endured years of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/education/bullying" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullying and social media pressures</a> and took her life on Sept. 4, 2023. It was very unexpected."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/american-idol-contestant-severe-stutter-leaves-judge-carrie-underwood-awe-over-beautiful-approach" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'AMERICAN IDOL' CONTESTANT WITH SEVERE STUTTER LEAVES JUDGE CARRIE UNDERWOOD IN AWE OVER 'BEAUTIFUL' APPROACH</strong></a></p><p>Before her audition, Khloe told host Ryan Seacrest the inspiration behind her song, "Forever 13."</p><p>"Something kept telling me to write that song, so I did," said Khloe, who had never met Aubreigh. "I felt it so much in my heart to write this song."</p><p>"This is my first time meeting her and thanking her for the song," Wyatt told the judges, before Khloe entered the room. The two immediately embraced in a big hug. </p><p>"Music is very powerful, and it can help let people know that they're not alone," Underwood told Khloe before the 15-year-old sang her original song dedicated to the late Aubreigh. </p><p>"I am just so moved," host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lionel-richie-calls-explosive-marriage-ending-fight-scandal-my-century-new-tell-all-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionel Richie</a> told Khloe after her audition. "That's a gift right there. That's God looking back at you."</p><p>"I feel like the maturity that you possess is quite incredible," Underwood said, before choking up. "The way you had your heart broken for someone you didn't even know and take that and basically say, put something positive is going to come out of it and potentially even think about all the people that hear that and see you and hear the story, maybe decide to change their mind about something, you know. It's pretty incredible."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

"We would pull up karaoke tracks, and we would just sing with each other, and since then I did choirs in school. If you haven't noticed, I have a stutter and that's really where kind of my love for singing came."</p><p>"I've had a stutter ever since I was little," Findling said during his confessional. "It's something that I've struggled with since elementary school. It was something embarrassing for me, and it was something that I really had a hard time with. I wouldn't raise my hand in school, and it was just something that made me feel alone and something that I felt like I had to hide. So it was definitely hard."</p><p>Findling said that singing has always "felt freeing" to him because his stutter disappears. </p><p>"When I sang, it was a way for me to express myself in a way where I didn't have to worry about being embarrassed or what people would think, or if somebody would laugh," he said. "It was an outlet for me when I was little, and it's still an outlet for me now."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lionel-richie-reveals-he-almost-became-priest-before-one-fans-comment-changed-his-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIONEL RICHIE REVEALS HE ALMOST BECAME A PRIEST BEFORE ONE FAN'S COMMENT CHANGED HIS LIFE</u></strong></a></p><p>During his performance of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pop-star-left-mormon-church-explains-why-he-refuses-try-drugs-alcohol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bensen Boone</a>'s "In The Stars," all three judges were visibly shocked at his approach. </p><p>"I don't think I blinked one time," Bryan said after the audition. "I mean, wow. You're a real singer. Thank you, man. I'm really proud of you. I love this show. I love this show because we get to meet kids like you."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"Your voice is beautiful," Underwood added. "You have a beautiful vibrato, a beautiful tone. We could understand everything you were singing, and you were in the song emotionally, which just took us right there with you, so it was beautiful."</p><p>"Problem. What problem?" Richie asked. "You don't have a problem. The only thing wrong with you is you've got to figure out how you're going to navigate this career."</p><p>"American Idol" airs Mondays on ABC and streams the next day on Hulu.</p>
