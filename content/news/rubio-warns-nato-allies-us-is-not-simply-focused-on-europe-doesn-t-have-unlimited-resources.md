<p>Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a> said Wednesday that he relayed to NATO allies that the U.S. "may be the richest country in the world, but we don't have unlimited resources." </p><p>Rubio made the remark at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/secretary-rubio-scheduled-face-former-colleagues-venezuela-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing</a> on U.S. policy toward Venezuela, during which he spoke about the American military operation to capture former dictator Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.  </p><p>"One of the things we've explained to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our allies in NATO</a> is the United States is not simply focused on Europe. We also have defense needs in the Western Hemisphere. We have defense needs in the Indo-Pacific, and it will require us – we may be the richest country in the world, but we don't have unlimited resources," Rubio said. </p><p>When pressed by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., on whether the U.S. still benefits from NATO, Rubio said, "We do. I mean, the problem, but NATO needs to be reimagined as well in terms of the obligations."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/keep-dreaming-natos-rutte-says-europe-needs-us-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NATO CHIEF WARNS EUROPE CAN'T DEFEND ITSELF WITHOUT US AS TENSIONS RISE OVER GREENLAND</strong></a></p><p>"And this is not new to this president. Multiple presidents have complained about it. I think this president just complains about it louder than other presidents," the secretary added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nato-warning-pushes-europe-face-cost-defending-itself" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP'S NATO WARNING PUSHES EUROPE TO FACE THE COST OF DEFENDING ITSELF</strong></a></p><p>Rubio added that prior to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maduro’s capture</a> on Jan. 3, "We had in our hemisphere a regime operated by an indicted narco-trafficker that became a base of operation for virtually every competitor, adversary and enemy in the world."</p><p>Rubio also said Wednesday, "We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago." </p><p>"I'm not here to claim to you this is going to be easy or simple," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/hearings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rubio told lawmakers</a>. "I am saying that in three and a half, almost four weeks, we are much further along on this project than we thought we would be, given the complexities of it going into it, and I recognize that it won't be easy. I mean, look, at the end of the day we are dealing with people over there that have spent most of their lives living in a gangster paradise." </p>
