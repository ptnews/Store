<p>Most people think identity theft starts with a massive hack. In reality, it usually starts much more quietly, with bits of personal information you didn't even realize were public: old addresses, family connections, phone numbers and shopping habits. </p><p>All are sitting on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data broker sites</a> that most people have never heard of. During Identity Theft Awareness Week, organized by the Federal Trade Commission, it's a good time to clear up some dangerous myths that keep putting people at risk, especially retirees, families and anyone who thinks they're "careful enough." </p><p>Let's break them down.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong> <br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

Over time, they build detailed profiles that can exist for decades, even if you've never been hacked. Scammers often use this data as a starting point. It helps them sound legitimate, personalize messages and choose the right angle to trick you.</p><p><strong>Reality:</strong> They usually have more than enough.</p><p>Scammers don't need your Social Security number to cause damage. A name, address history, phone number and family connections can be enough for someone to:</p><p>This is why scams often feel unsettlingly personal.</p><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Retirees are one of the <i>most targeted</i> groups.</p><p>Why? Because scammers assume:</p><p>Many scams are designed specifically for retirees, from Medicare updates to fake government notices and investment fraud. A recent widespread scam involves fake IRS calls and the illegitimate "Tax Resolution Oversight Department" that tries to steal your money.</p><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Credit monitoring only tells you <i>after</i> something has gone wrong.</p><p>It doesn't stop scammers from:</p><p>Think of credit monitoring like a smoke alarm-helpful, but it doesn't prevent the fire.</p><p><strong>Reality:</strong> You <i>can</i> take control, but doing it manually is time-consuming and frustrating.</p><p>Most data broker sites allow opt-outs, but each one has a different process. Some require forms. Others need ID verification. And many re-add your data months later. That's why I recommend a data removal service. These services contact hundreds of data brokers on your behalf, request the removal of your personal information and keep monitoring them so it doesn't quietly reappear. For families and retirees, this matters even more because once scammers connect relatives through broker profiles, multiple people can become targets.</p><p>While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.</p><p>Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><strong>Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: </strong><i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/illinois-dhs-data-breach-exposes-700k-residents-records" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ILLINOIS DHS DATA BREACH EXPOSES 700K RESIDENTS' RECORDS</strong></a></p><p>Identity theft rarely begins with a dramatic moment.</p><p>It usually starts with:</p><p>By the time fraud shows up on a credit report, the damage has often already been done.</p><p>If there's one takeaway this week, it's this: reducing your exposed data lowers your risk.</p><p>Do not trust surprise emails, texts or calls, even if they appear to come from a bank, retailer or government agency.
