<p>A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent is in the hospital after being ambushed during an attempt to arrest a Venezuelan national in Minneapolis on Wednesday evening, according to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Homeland Security</a>.</p><p>The agent was ambushed by two people while attempting to conduct a traffic stop on an illegal immigrant from Venezuela, DHS said, adding that the agent fired his gun during the alleged attack because he was "fearing for his life and safety." </p><p>One <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuelan suspect</a> was shot but is reported to be stable and is now in custody, DHS said.</p><p>The incident began at about 6:50 p.m. local time when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal law enforcement</a> attempted to make a traffic stop, according to DHS, who added that the suspect was released into the country under the Biden administration in 2022.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-seen-video-allegedly-blocking-minnesota-ice-operation-car-agitators-surround-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WOMAN SEEN ON VIDEO ALLEGEDLY BLOCKING MINNESOTA ICE OPERATION WITH CAR AS AGITATORS SURROUND AGENTS</strong></a></p><p>The suspect attempted to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ice-head-says-agents-facing-constant-impediments-after-migrant-seen-ramming-cars-while-trying-flee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evade arrest</a> by driving off but crashed into a parked car, DHS said. He then fled on foot.</p><p>According to DHS, when an officer caught up to the suspect and attempted to take him into custody, the suspect resisted and "violently assaulted the officer."</p><p>DHS said two additional individuals came out of a nearby apartment while the officer and suspect were engaged in a "struggle on the ground," and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle.</p><p>The original suspect broke free during the altercation and also began striking the officer with a shovel or broom handle, according to DHS.</p><p>The officer fired defensive shots to "defend his life," DHS said, and the suspect was hit in the leg.</p><p>All three suspects then barricaded themselves inside the apartment before being taken into custody, DHS said.</p><p>"This attack on another brave member of law enforcement took place while Minnesota’s top leaders, Governor Walz and Mayor Frey, are actively encouraging an organized resistance to ICE and federal law enforcement officers," DHS said in a statement.</p><p>The department added that the two leaders' "hateful rhetoric and resistance against men and women who are simply trying to do their jobs must end."</p><p>"Federal law enforcement officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest criminals and lawbreakers," DHS said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/omar-dems-demand-noem-impeachment-paint-minnesota-woman-shot-ice-poet-chose-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OMAR, DEMS DEMAND NOEM IMPEACHMENT, PAINT MINNESOTA WOMAN SHOT BY ICE AS 'POET' WHO CHOSE 'LOVE'</strong></a></p><p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a crowd was gathering at the scene and committing "unlawful acts," including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/federal-agents-deploy-tear-gas-rubber-bullets-protesters-outside-minneapolis-federal-building" target="_blank" rel="noopener">throwing fireworks at police officers.</a> He urged people to "leave immediately." </p><p>"This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further," he said, adding that authorities had deployed gas in the crowd multiple times.</p><p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called the ongoing situation in his city "not sustainable."</p><p>"This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in," he said at a news conference Wednesday evening, adding that the presence of roughly 3,000 ICE agents in Minneapolis and statewide was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jd-vance-ice-flip-script-sanctuary-city-leaders-chaos-erupts-across-mn-dangerous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"creating chaos."</a></p><p>"It's certainly not creating safety when a huge percentage of the shootings that have taken place so far this year in Minneapolis have been by ICE," he said. "So let's be very clear. I've seen <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minneapolis-mayor-frey-refuses-walk-back-get-f-out-message-ice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct from ICE</a> that is disgusting and is intolerable."</p><p>While Frey <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minneapolis-mayor-says-unconstitutional-ice-conduct-has-been-met-peaceful-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praised those protesting peacefully,</a> he warned that others were "taking the bait."</p><p>"We cannot counter Donald Trump's chaos with our own brand of chaos," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-anti-ice-agitators-swarm-confront-federal-agents-during-enforcement-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA ANTI-ICE AGITATORS SWARM, CONFRONT FEDERAL AGENTS DURING ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS</strong></a></p><p>Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> said in a statement early Thursday morning that state investigators were at the scene in North Minneapolis. </p><p>"I know you’re angry. I’m angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets," Walz wrote in a post on X. "But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don’t give him what he wants."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-agent-struck-renee-goods-vehicle-suffered-internal-bleeding-torso-dhs-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE AGENT STRUCK BY RENEE GOOD'S VEHICLE SUFFERED INTERNAL BLEEDING TO TORSO, DHS SAYS</strong></a></p><p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche reacted to the shooting Wednesday evening, assigning blame to Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.</p><p>"Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement," he wrote in a post on X. "It’s disgusting. Walz and Frey — I’m focused on stopping YOU from your terrorism by whatever means necessary. This is not a threat. It’s a promise."</p><p>White House Communications Director Steven Cheung slammed Walz on X following the incident.</p><p>"Thugs assault a law enforcement officer with a shovel after a traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien RELEASED BY BIDEN," he stated. "Perhaps they took some inspiration from Loser Tim Walz continually going after officers day in and day out."</p><p>The incident comes less than one week after Renee Nicole Good, 37, was killed by an ICE agent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Minneapolis</a> after she allegedly attempted to run him over with her car.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Mayor Frey and the office of Gov.
