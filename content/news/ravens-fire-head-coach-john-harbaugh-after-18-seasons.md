<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/baltimore-ravens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltimore Ravens</a> have fired veteran head coach John Harbaugh after 18 seasons, the team announced on Tuesday.  </p><p>The decision comes two days after Harbaugh's 2025 squad was unable to secure the AFC North title, losing in heartbreaking fashion to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> in Week 18. </p><p>"Following a comprehensive evaluation of the season and the overall direction of our organization, I decided to make a change at head coach," Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said in an official statement. "Today I informed John that he has been relieved of his duties.</p><p>"This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, most importantly, as a great man of integrity."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href="http://FOXNEWS.COM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>The Ravens also posted a statement from Harbaugh. </p><p>"Well, I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today. It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE &amp; APPRECIATION," Harbaugh said.</p><p>"Gratitude to the owner and organization who was willing to bring in a head coach who made his mark with Special Teams success. A difficult thing to do… and Appreciation for all the moments, all these years, that are etched into eternity. I hope a legacy built on Faith, always Fighting, always Believing."</p><p>It was a game that looked like it would end in a miraculous comeback for the Ravens on Sunday when rookie kicker Tyler Loop lined up for a 44-yard field goal to win the division and secure the No. 4 playoff seed in the AFC.</p><p>However, Loop’s kick went hard to the right as it flew through the Pittsburgh air, and the crowd went ballistic with the Steelers winning the division instead.</p><p>There was talk about whether this could be the end to Harbaugh’s storied time in Baltimore. And while Harbaugh's firing didn’t happen on "Black Monday" like other organizations, the Ravens are heading in a new direction for the first time since 2008.</p><p>Harbaugh quickly becomes the top head coaching candidate for teams searching to fill their own vacancies. Those teams include the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Giants</a>, Atlanta Falcons, Tennessee Titans, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/browns-fire-coach-kevin-stefanski" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BROWNS FIRE HEAD COACH KEVIN STEFANSKI AFTER SIX SEASONS</strong></a></p><p>Harbaugh owned a 180-113 record and a 13-11 postseason record during his 18 seasons with the franchise. He led the Ravens to a Super Bowl victory during the 2012 season after going 10-6.</p><p>Harbaugh, the brother of Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh, has the most road playoff victories in NFL history, showcasing his pedigree when the game matters most.</p><p>It shouldn’t be long before reports surface that Harbaugh has head coaching interviews on his calendar, considering teams are already working to hire new coaches to solidify their seasons in 2026.</p><p>As for the Ravens, there are available coaches like Kevin Stefanski, who the Ravens are familiar with given his last six seasons in the AFC North with the Browns. Raheem Morris is also on the move after the Falcons fired him after missing the playoffs.</p><p>The 63-year-old Harbaugh’s NFL coaching career began as the special teams coordinator with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1998 after stops in college at Western Michigan, Pitt, Morehead State, Cincinnati and Indiana.</p><p>Harbaugh spent 10 seasons in Philadelphia, nine as the special teams coordinator before getting his crack at a head coaching gig with the Ravens. He went 11-5 in his inaugural season and quickly developed the franchise into a formidable force in the AFC.</p><p>Through his 18 seasons, Harbaugh has only had a losing record three times, with his worst mark being the 2015 campaign at 5-11. The other two were 8-9 seasons in 2021 and 2025.</p><p>Harbaugh secured double-digit victories in 11 of those 18 seasons, including three straight from 2022-24.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
