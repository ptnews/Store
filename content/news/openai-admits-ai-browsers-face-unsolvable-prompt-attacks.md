<p>Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/browsers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers</a> are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong> </p><p>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.</p><p>OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that "agent mode" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.</p><p>OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.</p><p>This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/fake-ai-chat-results-spreading-dangerous-mac-malware" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE</u></strong></a></p><p>OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.</p><p>Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an "LLM-based automated attacker." In simple terms, OpenAI trained an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/hackers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI to act like a hacker</a>. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.</p><p>The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.</p><p>Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/third-party-breach-exposes-chatgpt-account-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS</strong></a></p><p>You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.</p><p>Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.</p><p>Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A password manager</a> ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.</p><p>Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see <i><strong>Cyberguy.com</strong></i>) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.</p><p>Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at <i><strong>Cyberguy.com</strong></i></p><p>Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.</p><p>The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.</p><p>Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android &amp; iOS devices at <i><strong>Cyberguy.com</strong></i></p><p>Telling an AI browser to "handle whatever is needed" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.</p><p>When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.</p><p>Security fixes for AI browsers evolve quickly as new attack techniques emerge. Delaying updates leaves known weaknesses open longer than necessary. Turning on automatic updates ensures you get protection as soon as they're available, even if you miss the announcement.</p><p>There's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.</p><p>Do you think AI browsers are worth the risk today, or are they moving faster than security can keep up?
