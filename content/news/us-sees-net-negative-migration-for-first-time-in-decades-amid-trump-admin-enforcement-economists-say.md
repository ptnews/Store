"In our assessment, net migration is likely to be very low or negative in 2026 as well." </p><p>"Reduced migration will dampen growth in the labor force, consumer spending, and gross domestic product (GDP). We estimate the sustainable pace of monthly job growth to be between 20,000 and 50,000 in late 2025 and believe it could be negative in 2026," the report added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minneapolis-mayor-says-unconstitutional-ice-conduct-has-been-met-peaceful-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR SAYS ‘UNCONSTITUTIONAL’ ICE CONDUCT HAS BEEN MET WITH ‘PEACEFUL’ PROTESTS</strong></a></p><p>The report also said, "Though deportations and other exits receive more media attention, a slowdown in new arrivals, especially via <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humanitarian parole and refugee programs</a> and across the Southwest border, has a bigger effect on reducing migration flows in 2025." </p><p>"The first year of the second Trump administration has seen <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-millions-illegal-immigrants-leave-us-record-breaking-year-trump-policies-dhs-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatic changes in immigration policy</a>, resulting in a sharp slowdown in net migration to the United States," according to the Brookings Institution. "We expect the pattern of restrictive policy and increased enforcement to continue or intensify through the coming year."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/la-county-eyes-ice-free-zones-government-property-despite-1b-federal-funding-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LOS ANGELES EYES ‘ICE-FREE ZONES’ ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY DESPITE $1 BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING AT RISK</strong></a></p><p>During the Biden administration, there was a surge in immigration with 2 to 3 million people arriving to the U.S. each year, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2026/01/13/trump-immigration-economy-net-negative-migration/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzY4MjgwNDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzY5NjYyNzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NjgyODA0MDAsImp0aSI6IjQ1MjEzOTkyLTVjNTItNDFkYy1hNmY4LWI3ZGQ2MmU2YjQxMyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI2LzAxLzEzL3RydW1wLWltbWlncmF0aW9uLWVjb25vbXktbmV0LW5lZ2F0aXZlLW1pZ3JhdGlvbi8ifQ.0yNgIgMgy_D--J8KZdCP9ELOX5KHKUOyup5Hbm7dH0A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>The Washington Post reported.</u></a> </p><p>"Our estimate of net migration of –295,000 to –10,000 for 2025 differs from some other prominent estimates.

"The CBO estimate includes fewer deportations than our estimate, and CBO also assumes voluntary out-migration falls in response to increased enforcement activity, whereas we assume it rises." </p>
