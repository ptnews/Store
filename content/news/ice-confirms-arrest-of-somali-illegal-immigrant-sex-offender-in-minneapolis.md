Additionally, the agency said Yusuf was arrested in 2016 for first-degree assault and has an active warrant from 2024 for obstructing police.</p><p>ICE said Yusuf first entered the U.S. in 1996 and was a lawful permanent resident, but "he threw away his shot at the American dream by repaying our country’s generosity with these vicious crimes."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-alleges-woman-killed-ice-shooting-stalking-impeding-agents-all-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NOEM ALLEGES WOMAN KILLED IN ICE SHOOTING WAS ‘STALKING AND IMPEDING’ AGENTS ALL DAY</strong></a></p><p>"Thanks to the sanctuary policies of Minnesota Governor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, this dangerous criminal was free to prowl the streets and victimize Minneapolis residents for years," ICE wrote in a statement.</p><p>Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) said agents previously attempted to arrest Yusuf but were obstructed by the apartment manager at his building. The manager allegedly blocked the agents from entering the building.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/sanctuary-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local sanctuary policies</a> and continued misinformation about what ICE operations actually entail continue to fuel these irresponsible, dangerous acts of obstructing law enforcement," HSI Special Agent in Charge Mark Zito said in a statement. </p><p>"Every time local jurisdictions refuse to cooperate with ICE, and every time activists use their ridiculous whistles and bullhorns to alert criminal aliens, they are helping violent offenders, including convicted sex predators like this one, escape justice."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-senate-candidate-mocked-after-claim-about-dismantling-ice-goes-viral-unmask-thugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>DEM SENATE CANDIDATE MOCKED AFTER CLAIM ABOUT DISMANTLING ICE GOES VIRAL: 'UNMASK THESE THUGS'</u></strong></a></p><p>In the news release regarding Yusuf's arrest, ICE claimed that since the Trump administration's illegal immigration crackdown began on Jan. 20, 2025, more than 622,000 deportations had been carried out.</p><p>Federal immigration authorities are under added scrutiny after an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-renee-nicole-good-woman-killed-minneapolis-ice-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renee Nicole Good</a> in Minneapolis.
