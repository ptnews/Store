<p>There's a beer on the market so strong it <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/cocktail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rivals cocktails</a> — and it's illegal in parts of the U.S.</p><p>Earlier in the fall, Samuel Adams announced the release of its Utopias 2025, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/drinks/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"barrel-aged extreme beer"</a> that packs an impressive 30% alcohol by volume (ABV).</p><p>"Utopias 2025 is one of the strongest beers ever brewed, and as a result, is illegal in 15 states," the release said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/tara-reids-disputed-drink-tampering-claim-leads-experts-warn-ill-intentions-strangers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TARA REID'S DISPUTED DRINK-TAMPERING CLAIM LEADS EXPERTS TO WARN AGAINST 'ILL INTENTIONS' OF STRANGERS</strong></a></p><p>The banned states are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia, according to the company.</p><p>Utopias is Samuel Adams' experimental beer program — designed to test the limits of beer aging and blending techniques.</p><p>The 2025 product is ruby-black and non-carbonated. Samuel Adams noted it "behaves as a fine spirit, as the bottle can be resealed to enjoy at a later date and should not be refrigerated."</p><p>The beer's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tasting notes</a> include "caramel, oak, dried fruit, subtle smoke and citrus," according to the release.</p><p>At 30% ABV, the beer is comparable to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/bars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common bar</a> liqueurs such as triple sec, schnapps and amaretto.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Samuel Adams for comment. </p><p>The beer comes in 24.5-ounce ceramic bottles with a suggested retail price of $240, though the price tags have shot up since its release in October.</p><p>Each bottle is good for between 12 and 24 servings, with a suggested serving size of 1 to 2 ounces.</p><p>Jim Koch, founder and brewer of Samuel Adams, called the new product "a remarkable milestone for Utopias."</p><p>"Not for the number itself, but for what it represents: the relentless pursuit of craft without compromise," he said in the company's news release.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Every vintage, barrel and bottle reflects decades of experimentation, innovation and collaboration, delivering a sipping experience that is truly unparalleled, collectible, memorable and worth the wait," he said in the same release. </p><p>Cesar Wurm, a Georgia-based hospitality executive and author of "The Powers of Addiction: Finding Freedom in Acceptance and Recovery," told Fox News Digital that 30% ABV beer is much closer in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcohol content</a> to hard liquor than traditional beers.</p><p>"For context, a typical 12-ounce beer at approximately 5% ABV contains about the same amount of alcohol as a 1.5-ounce shot of 40% spirits," he said.</p><p>"At 30% ABV, a similar-sized pour can contain six times that amount, which significantly increases the risk of rapid intoxication and alcohol poisoning if consumed too quickly or without realizing the strength."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>Wurm added there's a risk that consumers treat the Utopias 2025 beer the same way they do other brews — even though its content is much closer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/drinks/spirits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to that of spirits.</a></p><p>"That disconnect is where problems tend to occur," he said.</p><p>"From a consumer standpoint, this is not a product for casual drinking," he also said. </p><p>"Certain people, including those with low alcohol tolerance, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical conditions</a> affected by alcohol or a history of alcohol misuse should avoid it altogether."</p>
