"I know he and the president had a productive conversation. You know, our communication at the Department of Homeland Security has not been productive, with the mayor's office or <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the NYPD</a>, but we want to continue those conversations so we can work together on success."</p><p><a class="zReHs" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6387419115112"><strong>ICE-INVOLVED SHOOTING PROMPTS MASS PROTESTS</strong></a></p><p>Following a fatal ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis, Mamdani accused the officer of committing murder, while the administration has said the incident was a case of self-defense.</p><p>While the shooting took place multiple states away, it sparked anti-ICE protests in New York City.</p><p>"This morning, an ICE agent murdered a woman in Minneapolis — only the latest horror in a year full of cruelty," Mamdani wrote from his official mayoral <a href="https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/2009015792382390463" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">X account</a>.

That kind of language and that kind of provocative of talk, inciting people to take action and perpetuate violence in some cases, is unacceptable and especially of elected leaders," Noem said. "We have a responsibility to state the facts, to go out and enforce the law. Your mayor just said in that statement that he was going to stand with illegal people who have broken our law before."</p><p>Noem accused Mamdani of choosing "to stand with illegals instead of those individuals who just want the chance to raise their families in New York City and have a part of the American dream."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani and Williams' offices for comment.</p>
