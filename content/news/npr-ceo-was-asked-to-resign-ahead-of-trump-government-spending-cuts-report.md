"She didn’t believe that NPR was biased, and she thought saying so would undermine the organization and fail to placate those who were critical of the network, according to a person familiar with her thinking. After she refused, months of simmering tension between the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and NPR came to the surface. Ms. Harrison told Ms. Maher she should resign her position for the good of public media."</p><p>The call reportedly came before President Donald Trump issued an executive order in May <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-signs-executive-order-slash-taxpayer-funds-pbs-npr-radical-woke-propaganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defunding NPR</a> and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), both of which received funding from the CPB.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/npr-ceo-katherine-maher-vents-deep-frustration-over-gop-cuts-says-continue-operate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NPR CEO KATHERINE MAHER VENTS 'DEEP FRUSTRATION' OVER GOP CUTS, SAYS IT WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE</strong></a></p><p>Congress later stripped <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/why-trump-stripped-npr-of-federal-funding-and-what-happens-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $1 billion in funding</a> from the CPB in a recissions package pushed by Trump in July.</p><p>The New York Times report also revealed ongoing tension between NPR and CPB that led to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cpb-irked-npr-after-outlet-tries-block-58-million-dispersements-new-nonprofit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPR suing CPB</a> for allegedly redirecting congressionally-appropriated funds away from the radio organization in September.
