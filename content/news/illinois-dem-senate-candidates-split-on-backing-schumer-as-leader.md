Juliana Stratton said she would not support Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/chuck-schumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chuck Schumer, D-N,Y.,</a> if elected, drawing a clear contrast with her rivals during a debate Monday among the leading Democratic candidates for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat.</p><p>Asked directly whether they would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support Schumer as Senate leader</a>, the candidates offered varying levels of support.</p><p>Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said he was undecided and would "hear his pitch."</p><p>"I haven’t decided," he told the moderators at the debate, which was hosted by WBEZ, the Chicago Sun-Times, the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics and International House ahead of the March 2026 Democratic primary. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-senator-chuck-schumers-epic-face-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MORNING GLORY: SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER’S EPIC FACE PLANT</strong></a></p><p>Rep.
