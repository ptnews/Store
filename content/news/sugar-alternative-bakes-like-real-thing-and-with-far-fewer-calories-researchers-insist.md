<p>Scientists say they've developed a new way to produce a sugar alternative that may be healthier, taste more like the real thing and perform <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/techniques/baking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better in baked goods.</a></p><p>Many artificial sweeteners are known for aftertastes or digestive side effects, and some have raised consumer health concerns. Researchers at Tufts University say a new, rare type of sugar could offer a potential middle ground, according to findings published in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science in December.</p><p>The sugar, known as tagatose, occurs naturally in small amounts in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fruits and dairy</a> products. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/6-healthy-foods-could-secretly-spike-your-blood-sugar-what-eat-instead" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>6 HEALTHY FOODS THAT COULD SECRETLY SPIKE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR, AND WHAT TO EAT INSTEAD</strong></a></p><p>It tastes similar to table sugar but contains significantly fewer calories and has a smaller impact on blood sugar than sucrose, according to the researchers.</p><p>Tagatose delivers about 92% of the sweetness of regular sugar with roughly 60% fewer calories, the study found. Producing it at scale, however, has historically been difficult and costly.</p><p>"There are established processes to produce tagatose, but they are inefficient and expensive," Nikhil Nair, associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at Tufts, said in a statement.</p><p>"We developed a way to produce tagatose by engineering the bacteria Escherichia coli to work as tiny factories, loaded with the right enzymes to process abundant amounts of glucose into tagatose."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/beloved-cookie-brand-launches-sugar-free-product-not-everyone-sweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BELOVED COOKIE BRAND LAUNCHES SUGAR-FREE PRODUCT, BUT NOT EVERYONE IS SWEET ON IT</strong></a></p><p>In 2019, the team demonstrated a bacterial production method using galactose, a sugar that is less readily available and more expensive. The latest advance came from adding a newly identified enzyme, Nair said, that allows the bacteria to use glucose instead.</p><p>Researchers say the approach could eventually make tagatose more accessible for use in food products, though they caution that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">additional testing and optimization</a> are still required before it can be widely manufactured.</p><p>Tagatose has minimal impact on blood sugar and insulin levels, according to the scientists, making it a potential option for people trying to limit sugar intake or for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people with diabetes.</a></p><p>"Clinical studies show that tagatose raises blood glucose and insulin much less than conventional sugar, making it metabolically closer to low-glycemic sweeteners than to sucrose," Lakelyn Lumpkin, a Florida-based registered dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, told Fox News Digital.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Like other low-calorie sugars, tagatose may cause minor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gastrointestinal discomfort</a> in some people, experts say, particularly at higher intakes, since it's not fully absorbed in the small intestine.</p><p>"People with sensitivities to poorly absorbed carbohydrates … may experience digestive discomfort at higher doses," Lumpkin added.</p><p>Unlike some sugar substitutes, tagatose also behaves more like sugar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/cooking-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in cooking</a> and baking. Researchers say it browns when heated and produces a similar flavor and texture, characteristics often difficult to replicate with sugar substitutes.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</strong></a></p><p>Some studies suggest tagatose does not promote <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/dental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tooth decay</a> in the same way as sucrose and may influence gut bacteria because it is fermented in the colon rather than fully absorbed.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified tagatose as "generally recognized as safe," or GRAS, allowing it to be used as an ingredient in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumer foods.</a></p><p>While some consumers remain cautious about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/american-families-start-eating-lab-grown-meat-heres-what-know-cultivated-alternative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genetically modified food production</a>, Nair said the final tagatose product would be purified and would not contain the bacteria used in manufacturing. </p><p>He added that, chemically, the sugar would be indistinguishable from tagatose derived from natural sources.</p><p>Despite the promising results, researchers emphasized that significant work remains.</p><p>"There still needs to be significant optimization for productivity, scale-up and purification before it's ready for widespread manufacturing and distribution," Nair said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>While replacing some added sugars with alternatives like tagatose could help reduce caloric intake, overall dietary patterns remain critical, Lumpkin noted.</p><p>"Moderation of total sweetness, portion control and whole-diet quality remain central to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public health</a> recommendations," she said.</p>
