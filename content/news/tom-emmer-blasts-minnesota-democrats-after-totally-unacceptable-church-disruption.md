The organizer of that so-called protest was arrested this morning. I understand a school board member from the city of St. Paul was arrested as well and, hopefully, there'll be others."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-launches-civil-rights-investigation-after-minnesota-agitators-allegedly-storms-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOJ LAUNCHES CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATION AFTER MINNESOTA AGITATORS STORM CHURCH</strong></a></p><p>The disruption at Cities Church over the weekend happened amid heightened unrest in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twin Cities</a> after an ICE agent fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good during an operation in Minneapolis earlier this month.</p><p>Agitators, who were heard chanting, "Justice for Renee Good," and "Who needs justice, we need justice," alleged the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">church's pastor was affiliated with ICE</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/st-paul-pastor-denounces-anti-ice-agitators-who-disrupted-church-service-says-were-here-worship-jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ST PAUL PASTOR DENOUNCES ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO DISRUPTED CHURCH SERVICE, SAYS 'WE'RE HERE TO WORSHIP JESUS'</u></strong></a></p><p>Emmer speculated many of the agitators were "chaos agents" or paid protesters, adding that he believes the majority are from outside the state.</p><p>"It's very sad what's happening in our state, but I'm hopeful that it's going to settle down very soon," he said, accusing Gov.
