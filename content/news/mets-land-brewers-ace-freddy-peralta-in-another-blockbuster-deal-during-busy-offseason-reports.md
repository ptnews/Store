<p>It’s been a busy week for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-mets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Mets</a>, and it continued on Wednesday as they reportedly agreed to a trade to land Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta, giving them a much-needed upgrade in the starting rotation.</p><p>It took two of the Mets’ top five prospects to get the deal done, as <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/47687846/sources-mets-acquire-freddy-peralta-deal-brewers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ESPN reported</a> infielder Jett Williams (No. 3, per MLB Pipeline) and right-handed pitcher Brandon Sproat are heading to Milwaukee in the deal.</p><p>The Brewers are also sending right-hander Tobias Myers in the deal.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href="http://FOXNEWS.COM"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Peralta’s trade to the Mets marks yet another big move for New York’s GM David Stearns, who introduced Bo Bichette on Wednesday. Stearns also facilitated a trade to acquire <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/chicago-white-sox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago White Sox</a> outfielder Luis Robert Jr. on Tuesday night.</p><p>It’s been quite the offseason for the Mets, a team that fell short of postseason expectations last season despite having the second-highest payroll in baseball.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mets-agree-deal-all-star-bo-bichette-after-missing-out-kyle-tucker-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>METS AGREE TO DEAL WITH ALL-STAR BO BICHETTE AFTER MISSING OUT ON KYLE TUCKER: REPORTS</strong></a></p><p>Peralta should head to Flushing as the team’s ace to enter the 2026 season, with the Mets’ top prospect, Nolan McLean, figuring to be a top-line starter this year.</p><p>The Mets also have David Peterson, Clay Holmes, Kodai Senga, and Sean Manaea as rotation options this year.</p><p>Stearns bolstered the bullpen as well this offseason, most notably adding two former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-yankees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Yankees</a> in Devin Williams and Luke Weaver. Stearns and Williams worked together in Milwaukee while he was leading their front office, and though he had a down season, he’s in place to attempt a bounce-back as the Mets’ closer with Edwin Diaz heading to the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Myers adds some possible rotation depth for New York, as the 27-year-old has a 3.48 ERA across 31 starts since being called up in 2024. He also has relief appearances, marking a 1.62 ERA across 18 outings.</p><p>For the Brewers, they land Sproat, one of the Mets’ highly touted pitching prospects who was promoted last season amid rotation woes. He had a 4.79 ERA over four starts, though the 25-year-old had a 4.24 ERA and 113 strikeouts in 121 Triple-A innings.</p><p>Williams is a 5-foot-7 infielder who can also play center field. The 22-year-old hit .261 with 17 home runs, and his speed is undeniable with 34 stolen bases between Double- and Triple-A last season.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
