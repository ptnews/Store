<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> threatened on Saturday that he would implement 100% tariffs on Canada if it strikes a deal to become a "drop off port" for China.</p><p>"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make Canada a "drop off port"</a> for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken. China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life," Trump wrote on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115950424403894234" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Truth Social</a>.</p><p>"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.," the president added.</p><p>Trump referred to Canadian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mark-carney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Carney</a> as a "governor," echoing comments he made while campaigning for a second term about annexing America’s northern neighbor. He previously used the same term when speaking about Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/us-trade-rep-shrugs-off-world-leaders-swipes-trump-amid-davos-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US TRADE REP SHRUGS OFF WORLD LEADERS’ SWIPES AT TRUMP AMID DAVOS BACKLASH</strong></a></p><p>Carney made his first official visit to China earlier this month as he and Chinese President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/xi-jinping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xi Jinping</a> work together to forge an improved bond between their countries. </p><p>During the Jan. 14-17 visit, the leaders of the two nations reached an agreement that would allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles to enter the Canadian market at a lower tariff rate of 6.1%, <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2026/01/16/prime-minister-carney-forges-new-strategic-partnership-peoples" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Carney's office</a> announced. </p><p>"At its best, the Canada-China relationship has created massive opportunities for both our peoples. By leveraging our strengths and focusing on trade, energy, agri-food, and areas where we can make huge gains, we are forging a new strategic partnership that builds on the best of our past, reflects the world as it is today, and benefits the people of both our nations," Carney said in the statement.</p><p>Additionally, by March 1, China is expected to drop its tariff on Canadian canola seed to a combined rate of 15%. Carney's office said that Canada expects that its canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas will not be subject to relevant anti-discrimination tariffs beginning March 1 "until at least the end of this year."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/canadian-pm-carney-fires-back-trump-over-claim-canada-lives-because-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CANADIAN PM CARNEY FIRES BACK AT TRUMP OVER CLAIM THAT ‘CANADA LIVES BECAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES’</strong></a></p><p>It is unclear what deal would trigger a response from Trump in the wake of the ones made during Carney's trip to China.</p><p>Tensions between Carney and Trump have flared in recent days, as the leaders took swipes at one another <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-challenges-carney-davos-asserts-canada-should-grateful-golden-dome-missile-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the World Economic Forum</a> in Davos, Switzerland — and at home after the conference.</p><p>Carney, fresh off his trip to China, <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2026/01/20/principled-and-pragmatic-canadas-path-prime-minister-carney-addresses" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">delievered a speech</a> that garnered international attention. While he did not mention Trump by name, he made a reference to the U.S., saying that "rules-based order is fading." Many, including the U.S. president, saw this as a jab at Trump.</p><p>"Every day we’re reminded that we live in an era of great-power rivalry," Carney said. "That the rules-based order is fading. That the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-announces-escalating-tariffs-denmark-other-european-nations-force-greenland-purchase-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ANNOUNCES ESCALATING TARIFFS ON DENMARK AND OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS TO FORCE GREENLAND PURCHASE DEAL</strong></a></p><p>He admitted that there were benefits to U.S. leadership on the world stage, but painted the entire concept of a rules-based international order as a falsity that is actively failing. Additionally, in his address, Carney urged middle powers, like Canada, to assert themselves and take the opportunity to "build a new order that embodies our values."</p><p>"Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu," Carney said. </p><p>When delivering his address on Wednesday, Trump did not shy away from taking aim at Carney. He said that Canada "should be grateful" because the country gets "a lot of freebies" from the U.S., though he did not say what he was referring to.</p><p>"I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful," Trump said. "Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements."</p><p>In another apparent swipe at Carney, Trump issued an "open letter" to the Canadian leader on Truth Social <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-snubs-canada-withdrawing-countrys-invite-join-most-prestigious-board-leaders-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoking Canada's invitation</a> to join the Board of Peace, a U.S.-led council tasked with managing Gaza's post-war future.</p><p>"Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada’s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" Trump wrote on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115941901312153410" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><u>Truth Social</u></a>.</p><p>The inauguration of the Board of Peace took place after Carney had already departed, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/carney-canada-davos-trump-eee151f749f35c8b30a9ff4a9525d0be" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><u>The Associated Press</u></a>.</p><p>Upon his return to Canada, Carney addressed a cabinet retreat and took the opportunity to reject Trump's claim.</p><p>"Canada and the United States have built a remarkable partnership in the economy, in security, and in a rich cultural exchange," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mark-carney" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Carney said</u></a> on Thursday while speaking in Plains of Abraham, Québec, during a cabinet retreat. </p><p>"But Canada doesn’t ‘live because of the United States’," he said, referencing Trump's remark. "Canada thrives because we are Canadian. We are masters in our own house. This is our country. This is our future. The choice is ours."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and Carney's office for comment.</p>
