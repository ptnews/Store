<p>Two decades after Jennifer Kesse mysteriously disappeared, her parents say they continue to search for their daughter every day as emerging technology gives them a sense of optimism.</p><p>Jennifer Kesse was 24 years old when she vanished on January 24, 2006, after failing to show up for work in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/orlando" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orlando, Florida</a>. In an interview with Fox News affiliate WTVT, marking 20 years since her disappearance, her parents, Drew and Joyce Kesse, described how the passage of time has not brought closure.</p><p>"We look for Jennifer pretty much every day," they said. "It seems like an eternity. It seems that we’re still living in a surreal state."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/fathers-pursuit-missing-daughter-heats-up-new-evidence-case-thats-no-longer-cold" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FATHER'S PURSUIT FOR MISSING DAUGHTER HEATS UP WITH NEW EVIDENCE IN CASE THAT'S NO LONGER COLD</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer’s car</a> was later found about a mile from her home. Surveillance video showed a person of interest parking her car and walking away, but the individual’s face was not visible.</p><p>Drew previously shared with Fox News Digital that after Jennifer's work called to report that she failed to show, he immediately tried to reach his daughter – relying on a family rule that they would always answer each other's calls – but her phone went straight to voicemail. </p><p>"I knew something was wrong immediately," Kesse said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/jonbenet-ramsey-case-could-benefit-from-new-dna-technology-police-renew-commitment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JONBENET RAMSEY CASE COULD BENEFIT FROM NEW DNA TECHNOLOGY AS POLICE RENEW COMMITMENT</strong></a></p><p>Drew and Joyce made the two-hour drive from their home in Tampa to Orlando, where they found their daughter’s apartment empty with several outfit choices laid out on her bed. </p><p>The parents immediately called the Orlando Police Department (OPD) to report Jennifer missing. </p><p>"They looked around her apartment, shrugged their shoulders and said, ‘She had a fight with her boyfriend probably, she’ll be back,’" Kesse said. "They walked out. And that was Jennifer’s last chance."</p><p>The Kesses later sued OPD to gain access to Jennifer’s case file, which spans more than 16,000 pages.</p><p>"It exhausts you. It drains you physically, mentally and emotionally, and it will in time take a toll on your actual physical health," they told FOX 13.</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Department of Law Enforcement</a> (FDLE) now overseeing the case, the Kesses said they are pursuing new investigative approaches, including working with an artificial intelligence firm to analyze the case file and surveillance video.</p><p>One focus has been on identifying the person of interest through <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical characteristics</a> visible in the video.</p><p>"An ear is just like an eye or a fingerprint. It’s very unique to a person," Drew said. "When we find the ear, then we’ve found the person."</p><p>The Kesses also said new DNA samples were tested last year and that investigators are closer than ever to identifying several people they would like to speak with.</p><p>As they continue to wait for answers, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer’s parents</a> said they still believe she was taken shortly after disappearing.</p><p>"I personally still think that Jennifer was taken and taken out of the area — state and maybe country — very quickly," her father said, adding that he believes she may have been targeted because she was alone.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxTrueCrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X</strong></a></p><p>Now nearing 70, Jennifer’s parents said their determination has not faded since the search began two decades ago.</p><p>"Till we die," Joyce said. "Whatever it takes. There’s no quit in us."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING?
