<p>Throughout 2025, many instances of Americans exercising their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/second-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right to bear arms</a> to protect themselves, their families and their property made headlines across the country. </p><p>As of Dec. 23, the U.S. had seen 14,249 gun-related deaths and 25,606 injuries since the start of the year, <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>according to</u></a> the Gun Violence Archive. </p><p>Of those instances, 1,119 shootings were deemed to be in self-defense, with many cases going unprosecuted due to various laws throughout the country permitting the use of guns in life-threatening situations. </p><p>Take a look at some of the most compelling justifiable shootings that occurred throughout 2025, in which Americans used guns to fight back against would-be robbers, attempted mass shooters and suspected home invaders.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/off-duty-texas-deputy-fatally-shoots-man-allegedly-trying-enter-car-his-small-child-inside" target="_blank"
