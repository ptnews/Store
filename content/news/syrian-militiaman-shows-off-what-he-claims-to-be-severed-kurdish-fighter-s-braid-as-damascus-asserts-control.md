<p>A video showing a Syrian militiaman holding what he claims to be a severed braid belonging to a Kurdish fighter killed in Raqqa has sparked outrage as Damascus moves to assert control in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/syria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">northeastern Syria</a> amid a fragile ceasefire.</p><p>In the video, the man holds up what appears to be a cut braid. He is said to tell the person filming that he took it from a woman he claims was affiliated with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). </p><p>When asked why, he responds, "She’s already gone, what will she do?" according to London-based news outlet<i><strong> </strong></i><a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/syrian-fighter-holds-braid-sdf-womans-hair-causes-outrage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">New Arab.</a><br><br>The video prompted an online campaign and protests where Kurdish women braided their hair in solidarity.  Outrage continued to grow as control in northeastern Syria began to shift, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRjjh6ETdfA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AFP</a> reported.<br><br><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-says-syria-using-force-option-against-us-backed-fighters-who-helped-defeat-isis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TURKEY SAYS SYRIA USING FORCE IS AN OPTION AGAINST US-BACKED FIGHTERS WHO HELPED DEFEAT ISIS</strong></a></p><p>"The video highlighted the fears many Kurds have about what Syrian government control could mean for their communities," Syria analyst <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/nanar-hawach" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Nanar Hawach told</a> Fox News Digital.</p><p>"The Damascus-affiliated fighter held up a severed braid, claiming he cut it from a YPJ fighter killed in Raqqa, but he later claimed it was ‘artificial’ and ‘a joke.’ The woman’s identity and fate remain unverified," Hawach, of <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">International Crisis Group</a>, said</p><p>"The response matters more than the video though," he added, noting that the braid carries "cultural significance in Kurdish tradition and has become a symbol of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/lindsey-graham-says-strong-consensus-protect-kurds-syrian-forces-advance-territory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women’s resistance."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-strike-eliminates-al-qaeda-operative-connected-isis-ambush-killed-3-americans-syria" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US STRIKE ELIMINATES AL QAEDA OPERATIVE CONNECTED TO ISIS AMBUSH THAT KILLED 3 AMERICANS IN SYRIA</strong></a></p><p>The incident comes as Damascus, under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, pushes to expand its reach and authority into areas long governed by the SDF, the U.S.' main partner in the fight against ISIS in Syria.</p><p>Raqqa, once the Islamic State group’s de facto capital, has also seen fighting emerge across the region between Syrian government forces and Kurdish units, prompting a U.S.-brokered cease-fire on Jan. 18.</p><p>The truce followed diplomatic efforts by U.S. envoy Tom Barrack, who met SDF commander Mazloum Abdi and Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani in Erbil on Jan. 17 before traveling to Damascus to meet al-Sharaa, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-envoy-calls-syria-truce-be-upheld-2026-01-22/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reported.</p><p>"This new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/treaties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15-day ceasefire extension</a> has created a real diplomatic window, but postpones rather than resolves the fundamental dispute," Hawach said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/isis-fighters-break-free-from-syrian-jail-amid-chaotic-government-handover" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ISIS FIGHTERS BREAK FREE FROM SYRIAN JAIL AMID CHAOTIC GOVERNMENT HANDOVER</strong></a></p><p>"For Syria’s Kurds, the extension offers temporary relief but perhaps little certainty about what comes next," he said.

If they cannot bridge that gap, renewed fighting is possible when this new 15-day ceasefire expires," he said.</p>
