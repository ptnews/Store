<p>Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., was confronted over his refusal to stand during President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump’s</a> joint address to Congress when honoring families of children raped and murdered by illegal immigrants.</p><p>In a heated exchange with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Thanedar criticized the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.</p><p>"I did not stand because the president, I was just sick of the president," Thanedar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/hannity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Friday on "Hannity."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/omar-dems-demand-noem-impeachment-paint-minnesota-woman-shot-ice-poet-chose-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OMAR, DEMS DEMAND NOEM IMPEACHMENT, PAINT MINNESOTA WOMAN SHOT BY ICE AS 'POET' WHO CHOSE 'LOVE'</strong></a></p><p>Hannity responded, "You wouldn't stand for families that lost children — a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-suspect-jocelyn-nungaray-case-accused-raping-american-woman-costa-rica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12-year-old girl</a> raped and murdered — and you couldn't stand for them because you were playing politics."</p><p>"I would not stand for this president," Thanedar reiterated. "He was lying."</p><p>Thanedar claimed Trump was "using a tragedy" for political purposes.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wave-car-attacks-ice-agents-follows-incendiary-rhetoric-from-target-city-leaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WAVE OF CAR ATTACKS ON ICE AGENTS FOLLOWS INCENDIARY RHETORIC FROM TARGET-CITY LEADERS</strong></a></p><p>During the speech, Trump honored several young women whom law enforcement says were murdered by illegal immigrants, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/president-donald-trump-joint-session-not-state-of-the-union-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jocelyn Nungaray.</a></p><p>Many <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats in the chamber</a> remained seated as the families were recognized, including Jocelyn’s mother, Alexis Nungaray, who was in attendance. Nungaray later described the Democrats’ reaction as "shameful" during a March appearance on "Hannity."</p><p>"I found it very cowardly that a lot of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats didn’t stand</a>, didn’t clap, didn’t do anything to support anything that Donald Trump was trying to do as president to make this country better," Nungaray said.</p><p>"It’s just very disgraceful to us as U.S. citizens that those are the people we have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here in Congress</a>".</p><p>During Friday’s segment, Hannity repeatedly pressed Thanedar on whether he had personally contacted families of Americans killed by illegal immigrants.
