"Rioters and terrorists have assaulted law enforcement, launched fireworks at them, slashed the tires of their vehicles, and vandalized federal property. Others have chosen to ignore commands and have attempted to impede law enforcement operations and used their vehicles as weapons against our officers."</p><p>McLaughlin added that "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assaulting and obstructing law enforcement</a> is a felony." </p><p>"Despite these grave threats and dangerous situations, our law enforcement has followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property," she stated.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-anti-ice-agitators-swarm-confront-federal-agents-during-enforcement-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA ANTI-ICE AGITATORS SWARM, CONFRONT FEDERAL AGENTS DURING ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS</strong></a></p><p>Under the ruling, federal agents cannot use pepper-spray or other non-lethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against peaceful protesters, the ruling states.</p><p>Additionally, Menendez wrote that safely following officers "at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop."</p><p>The ruling stems from a case filed in December on behalf of six Minnesota activists, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, who argued that government officers were violating the constitutional rights of Twin City residents.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/omar-minneapolis-mayor-accuse-trump-admin-unleashing-political-retribution-invasion-ice-activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OMAR, MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR ACCUSE TRUMP ADMIN OF UNLEASHING 'POLITICAL RETRIBUTION,' 'INVASION' WITH ICE ACTIVITY</strong></a></p><p>Government attorneys said officers were acting within their legal authority and appropriately to violence as they've enforced immigration laws across the country and in Minnesota.</p><p>The ongoing unrest in Minneapolis comes after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/three-venezuelan-illegals-arrested-ice-officer-ambushed-attacked-traffic-stop-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two recent shootings</a> involving ICE agents in the city.</p><p>Good died on Jan. 7 after an ICE agent shot into her vehicle through the driver's side windshield and open window after she allegedly attempted to run him over.
