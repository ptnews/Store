"Some I return to again and again, not just for insight, but for alignment."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-news-dana-perino-announces-fiction-debut-purple-state-small-town-romantic-comedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOX NEWS' DANA PERINO ANNOUNCES FICTION DEBUT WITH ‘PURPLE STATE,’ A SMALL-TOWN ROMANTIC COMEDY</strong></a></p><p>The first of the 17 books she shared was "The Women" by bestselling author Kristin Hannah, a work of historical fiction. </p><p>"This novel is a story of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/heroism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courage, resilience</a> and sisterhood set against war," the first daughter wrote. "It restores women to the center of history and reminds us that some of the bravest acts of service are in the shadows."</p><p>Trump also shared a classic of literature, adding that each year she reads or rereads books her three children are assigned in school. She said this year she is reading "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/classics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Odyssey</a>" by Homer again with her daughter, Arabella.</p><p>"'The Odyssey' honors the long arc of adventure: trials, temptation, wonder and the resolve it takes to press on," she wrote.</p><p>The first daughter shared "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn, which she called "a quiet, radical dialogue that questions our definition of ‘civilized’ and asks what we’ve traded away to sustain it."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>She also listed "The Creative Act" by Rick Rubin. Trump said it is a "meditation on perceiving the world as art in motion and on discipline not as constraint, but as devotion."</p><p>Hungarian psychologist Dr. Edith Eger’s "The Choice" was also mentioned, with Trump noting the book shares "proof that even in profound darkness, freedom is an inner decision."</p><p>"The Art of Learning" by Josh Waitzkin, a former champion chess player, martial arts champion and author, was listed as "a book about mastery through presence and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/good-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beauty of deliberate practice</a>."</p><p>Trump also noted "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" by Richard Bach, calling it "a fable for those unwilling to live within borrowed limits" and framing "flight as [a] metaphor."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</strong></a></p><p>Modern stoicism was shared in "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" by Eric Jorgenson. "Ravikant offers clarity on wealth, wisdom and happiness," said Trump.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lessons of History</a>" by Will and Ariel Durant reminded Trump that perspective is the rarest form of wisdom.</p><p>The book offers "a sweeping distillation of centuries of human civilization. Power, culture, war, religion and economics [are] reduced to their enduring patterns," she wrote.</p><p>"The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell was listed as "a luminous exploration of how our private lives echo timeless myths," noted Trump. "It distills Campbell’s mastery with clarity and warmth."</p><p>She also listed "A History of Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russell — calling it an "intellectual pilgrimage through the architecture of human thought."</p><p>As America approaches <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/america-250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its 250th anniversary</a>, Trump pointed to "The Pursuit of Happiness" by Jeffrey Rosen.
