<p>The Trump administration announced a $2 billion pledge for United Nations humanitarian aid Monday and warned that agencies must "adapt, shrink, or die" under its overhaul, according to a statement from the <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/under-secretary-for-foreign-assistance-humanitarian-affairs-and-religious-freedom/2025/12/more-lives-saved-for-fewer-taxpayer-dollars-trump-administration-leads-humanitarian-resetin-the-united-nations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of State</a>.</p><p>The new package comes as the administration reins in traditional foreign assistance and pushes humanitarian organizations to meet stricter standards on efficiency, accountability and oversight.</p><p>"Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die," the statement said after outlining what it called "several key benefits for the United States and American taxpayers."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-must-make-un-funding-conditional-real-reforms-ex-diplomat-urges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP MUST MAKE UN FUNDING CONDITIONAL ON REAL REFORMS, EX-DIPLOMAT URGES</strong></a></p><p>"The United States is pledging an initial $2 billion anchor commitment to fund <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">life-saving assistance activities</a> in dozens of countries," the State Department said.</p><p>The administration also said that the contribution is expected to shield tens of millions of people from hunger, disease and the devastation of war in 2026 alone, with a new model significantly reducing costs. </p><p>"Because of enhanced efficiency and hyper-prioritization on life-saving impacts, this new model is expected to save U.S. taxpayers nearly $1.9 billion compared to outdated grant funding approaches," the statement said.</p><p>Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a> said the approach is intended to force <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-officially-kills-usaid-reveals-future-foreign-assistance-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-standing reforms across</a> the U.N. system and reduce the U.S. financial burden.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-unloads-alarmists-touts-state-dept-disaster-response-after-usaid-closure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUBIO UNLOADS ON ‘ALARMISTS,’ TOUTS STATE DEPT DISASTER RESPONSE AFTER USAID CLOSURE</strong></a></p><p>"This new model will better share the burden of U.N. humanitarian work with other developed countries and will require the U.N. to cut bloat, remove duplication, and commit to powerful new impact, accountability, and oversight mechanisms," Rubio said in a post on X.</p><p>The pledge is smaller than previous U.S. contributions, which officials said had grown to between $8 billion and $10 billion annually in voluntary humanitarian funding in recent years.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Administration officials</a> said those funding levels were unsustainable and lacked sufficient accountability.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-weighs-terrorism-sanctions-against-un-palestinian-aid-agency-over-hamas-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ADMIN WEIGHS TERRORISM SANCTIONS AGAINST UN PALESTINIAN AID AGENCY OVER HAMAS ALLEGATIONS</strong></a></p><p>Jeremy Lewin, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Department’s senior official</a> overseeing foreign assistance, underscored the administration’s position during a press conference in Geneva.</p><p>"The piggy bank is not open to organizations that just want to return to the old system," Lewin said in the statement. "President Trump has made clear that the system is dead."</p><p>The funding commitment is part of a newly signed Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).</p><p>The agreement replaces project-by-project grants with consolidated, flexible pooled funding administered at the country or crisis level.</p><p>Tom Fletcher, the U.N.’s top humanitarian official and head of OCHA, welcomed the agreement, calling it a major breakthrough. "It’s a very significant landmark contribution," Fletcher said, according to The Associated Press.</p><p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz also said the deal would deliver more focused, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-how-we-take-america-first-united-nations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results-driven aid aligned</a> with U.S. foreign policy interests, while the State Department warned future funding will depend on continued reforms.</p>
