<p>The organization that oversees the Nobel Peace Prize rejected recent suggestions that Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado could give or share her award with President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>.</p><p>The Norwegian Nobel Institute shut down the idea Friday, after Machado suggested that she might transfer the prestigious award to Trump earlier this week.</p><p>"Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others," the institute said in a statement. "The decision is final and stands for all time."</p><p>The statement comes after Machado floated the idea during an appearance Tuesday on Fox News' "Hannity."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/united-nations-upset-trump-took-bold-action-improve-venezuela-says-un-amb-mike-waltz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UNITED NATIONS 'UPSET' THAT TRUMP TOOK 'BOLD ACTION' TO IMPROVE VENEZUELA, SAYS UN AMB. MIKE WALTZ</strong></a></p><p>"Did you at any point offer to give him the Nobel Peace Prize?" Sean Hannity asked. "Did that actually happen?"</p><p>Machado responded, "Well, it hasn’t happened yet."</p><p>"I certainly would love to be able to personally tell him that we believe — the Venezuelan people, because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people — certainly want to give it to him and share it with him," Machado continued. "What he has done is historic. It’s a huge step towards a democratic transition."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-says-maduro-capture-reinforces-alien-enemies-act-removals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ADMIN SAYS MADURO CAPTURE REINFORCES ALIEN ENEMIES ACT REMOVALS</strong></a></p><p>On Jan. 3, Trump announced that the U.S. had successfully completed an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-embraces-us-interventionism-venezuela-he-sets-sights-cuba-colombia-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operation to capture authoritarian</a> Venezuelan President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nicolas-maduro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicolás Maduro</a>, who is now facing drug trafficking charges in New York.</p><p>Trump was asked during an appearance Thursday on "Hannity" whether he would accept the Nobel Prize from Machado.</p><p>"I've heard that she wants to do that," Trump responded.

As soon as I learned that we had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, I dedicated it to President Trump because I believed at that point that he deserved it," Machado said on "Hannity." "And a lot of people, most people, said it was impossible to achieve what he has just done on Saturday, January 3rd."</p><p>Trump said he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-plans-meet-venezuela-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to meet with</a> the Venezuelan opposition leader in Washington next week.</p><p>He has previously stated that Machado "doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country" to lead. Trump has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-backs-maduro-loyalist-over-venezuela-opposition-leader-post-capture-transition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported acting President Delcy</a> Rodríguez, a longtime Maduro loyalist, who previously served as vice president under Maduro.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Landon Mion contributed to this report.</i></p>
