<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ufc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFC</a> CEO and President Dana White brushed off concerns that a planned White House fight card marking America’s 250th anniversary would be "too political," saying that "just about everybody on the roster" wants to compete.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2026-01-16/dana-white-on-ufc-at-the-white-house-future-of-boxing-video" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Bloomberg’s Romaine Bostick</u></a> Friday, White was asked if he thought it would be a challenge to get fighters to participate in the UFC event scheduled for June out of fear that it would be "too political" or have "too many political overtones." </p><p>White, a longtime friend and supporter of President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>, rejected the concern, noting that many presidents have had personal interests in various sports.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"I mean, I don’t know how it would be too political other than it’s at the White House," he responded with a laugh.</p><p>"Listen, if you look back throughout history, I think [former President] George Bush was a big baseball fan, [former President Barack] Obama was an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">NBA</a> fan and Trump is a UFC fan. I don’t think that any of those guys being fans made any sport too political." </p><p>White said his staff has the logistics of the event "dialed in" and noted that around 5,000 will be able to view the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-white-house-plans-revealed-including-weigh-ins-lincoln-memorial-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fights on the White House lawn</a> while an additional 85,000 people will be able to view the fights on big screens at The Ellipse. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-star-hopes-get-white-house-fight-card-after-campaigning-trump-save-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>UFC STAR HOPES TO GET ON WHITE HOUSE FIGHT CARD AFTER CAMPAIGNING WITH TRUMP TO 'SAVE AMERICA'</u></strong></a></p><p>"We’re going to take over <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington, D.C.</a> the week of the fight," White said. </p><p>White went on to say that nearly all of his fighters have expressed interest in participating in the event, but that a final decision has not been made.</p><p>"Just about everybody on the roster wants to fight on the card. It’s a one-of-one special event. I mean, when will there ever be another fight or sporting event at the White House. It’s a history-making event, and we’ll see how this year plays out with different fighters. And you want the biggest, the best, and you want the card to be great."</p><p>White sat alongside the president Monday in a suite at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, as the pair watched the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/indiana-hoosiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Hoosiers</a> capture the first national title in program history with a victory over the Miami Hurricanes in the College Football Playoff championship game.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
