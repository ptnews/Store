<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> told MS NOW host Joe Scarborough that the U.S. was going to "keep the oil," following the strikes in Venezuela and the capture of Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>"I’ve spoken with Donald Trump probably half a dozen times since he was back in the White House. And yesterday was the first time I talked to him in a few months. And I called to get the reaction, and to see what I might be able to glean on what was coming next," Scarborough revealed on Tuesday.</p><p>Scarbrough said he and the president talked about the flawlessness of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-venezuela-strike-sparks-constitutional-clash-maduro-hauled-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military operation that captured Maduro</a> and explained that he pressed Trump on running Venezuela and comparisons to President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq.</p><p>"When I pressed comparisons with America’s failed occupation of Iraq, the president’s response was very different. I asked him, I said, Mr. President, when you say, 'we’re going to run everything,' that obviously causes deep concerns because of the disaster in Iraq. The president’s response: 'Joe, the difference between Iraq and this is that Bush didn’t keep the oil. We’re going to keep the oil,'" Scarborough said, quoting Trump.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/maduro-met-chinese-envoy-hours-before-us-capture-from-caracas-beijing-slams-operation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MADURO MET CHINESE ENVOY HOURS BEFORE US CAPTURE FROM CARACAS AS BEIJING SLAMS OPERATION</u></strong></a></p><p>The MS NOW host said Trump took his remarks off background and quoted the president as saying, "In 2016, I said we should have kept the oil. It caused a lot of controversy. Well, we should have kept the oil."</p><p>"We’re going to rebuild their broken-down oil facilities, and this time we’re going to keep the oil," Trump said, according to Scarborough.</p><p>Scarborough added, "Saying the United States is entering a new era of geopolitical engagement seems to be an understatement."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maduro-appears-us-court-arraignment-questions-swirl-over-venezuelas-fate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>DEFIANT MADURO DECLARES HE IS A 'PRISONER OF WAR' IN FIRST US COURT APPEARANCE</u></strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-us-run-venezuela-until-safe-transition-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump said Saturday</a> that the U.S. would "run" Venezuela until what he described as a safe, proper and judicious transition can take place.</p><p>Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were indicted in the Southern District of New York on federal charges that include narco-terrorism conspiracy, conspiracy to import cocaine and weapons-related charges. </p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</strong></a></p><p>Maduro and his wife pleaded not guilty to the charges. </p><p>Venezuela, a country almost twice the size of California, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/3-key-takeaways-from-trumps-push-put-us-oil-firms-back-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sits atop extraordinary wealth</a> in the form of its enormous oil reserves.</p><p>With more than 300 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Venezuela</u></a> holds more crude than established energy heavyweights like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait. The Latin American country’s reserves are nearly quadruple those of the United States.</p><p>Once a major <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>oil</u></a> producer, the country pumped about 3.5 million barrels a day in the late 1990s. Since then, its oil industry has sharply deteriorated, with production falling to roughly 800,000 barrels a day, according to energy analytics firm Kpler.</p><p>Trump said on Saturday he would seek to revive the once-prominent commodity by mobilizing investment from major U.S. energy companies.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Amanda Macias contributed to this report.</i></p>
