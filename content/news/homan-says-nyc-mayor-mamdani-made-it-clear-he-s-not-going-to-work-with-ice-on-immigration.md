<p>Trump border czar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-homan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Homan</a> said Tuesday he has had no communication with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, accusing the newly inaugurated democratic socialist of refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.</p><p>"He's made it clear he's not going to work with ICE," Homan told "America's Newsroom."</p><p>"When Mayor Adams was here… we had an agreement that he would allow us back into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rikers Island</a> to arrest those public safety threats in the safety and security of a jail, but the city council shut it down."</p><p>Homan went on to cite a meeting last year between President Donald Trump and Mamdani, saying it remains unclear whether the mayor will change course and help bring alleged threats to society to justice.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mamdani-pledges-nyc-remain-sanctuary-city-after-chummy-trump-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MAMDANI PLEDGES NYC TO REMAIN SANCTUARY CITY AFTER CHUMMY TRUMP MEETING</strong></a></p><p>"We'll see down the road if he's going to help arrest public safety threats," he said.</p><p>"We're not asking any NYPD to be immigration officers. We're asking their cops to work with our cops to remove national security threats and public safety threats in New York City."</p><p>Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristi-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Noem</a> offered similar remarks last week, telling reporters that talks involving Mamdani and the Department of Homeland Security are reportedly not going well.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mamdani-calls-ice-detention-nyc-employee-assault-our-democracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MAMDANI CALLS ICE DETENTION OF NYC EMPLOYEE 'ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY'</strong></a></p><p>"We're hoping the mayor will work with us to get these criminal elements, and especially gang members and terrorist organizations, out of New York City," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristi-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Noem</u></a> said during a news conference. </p><p>"I know he and the president had a productive conversation. Our communication at the Department of Homeland Security has not been productive with the mayor's office or <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>with the NYPD</u></a>, but we want to continue those conversations so we can work together on success."</p><p>Mamdani's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p>Mamdani has espoused <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-ICE rhetoric</a> since rising to prominence in the race for New York City mayor last year, encouraging those confronted by the agency to "know [their] rights" in a video last month and listing ways to handle potentially risky encounters with agents.</p><p><i>Fox News' Rachel Wolf and Bryan Llenas contributed to this report.</i></p>
