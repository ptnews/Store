<p>A woman from California has an unusual practice. She scours cemeteries to find and cook recipes left by the deceased — and etched on their tombstones.</p><p>Over the last five years, Rosie Grant, a librarian from Los Angeles, has collected <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 recipes</a> this way. She says the food is "to die for."</p><p>The idea of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/cooking-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooking and sharing</a> a last meal of sorts with those who have passed away came from an unlikely place: an internship she had at a cemetery in New York.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/workers-unusual-lunch-spot-backfires-uncomfortable-confrontation-being-disrespectful" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WORKER'S UNUSUAL LUNCH SPOT BACKFIRES AFTER UNCOMFORTABLE CONFRONTATION: 'WAS I BEING DISRESPECTFUL?'</strong></a></p><p>During her work there, she noticed a recipe for spritz cookies carved into a woman's headstone.</p><p>She went home <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/techniques/baking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and baked</a> 12 of the treats — before returning to the grave and eating them. That started her mission of finding other gravestones with recipes.</p><p>"In the beginning, when I knew one recipe, I thought this would be a one-off," she told news agency SWNS.</p><p>Grant, 36, has now concocted recipes ranging from Texas sheet cake and no-bake cookies to guava cobbler.</p><p>The goal, she said, is to cook and share a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last meal</a> with those who have passed away.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2000-year-old-roman-recipes-brought-back-life-heres-what-taste-like" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2,000-YEAR-OLD ROMAN RECIPES BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE — HERE'S WHAT THEY ACTUALLY TASTE LIKE</strong></a></p><p>To date, she's created 40 recipes from beyond the grave, including meatloaf, peanut butter cookies, yeast cake and nut rolls. </p><p>In 2024, Grant headed to Alaska to make one of the recipes with the deceased's family.</p><p>They invited Grant to join them in Nome, Alaska, to craft the no-bake cookie from their departed loved one's headstone.</p><p>"The family [was] so gracious," Grant said. "I went to their kitchen. I cooked with [the woman's] daughter and great-granddaughter, and we took the cookies to the cemetery."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Grant called it the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/good-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most wonderful experience</a> she's ever had.</p><p>These days, Grant doesn't get many of her recipes from researching gravestones herself. Instead, she is sent the recipes from family members who are hoping to keep a loved one's legacy alive. </p><p>"I will also be sent recipes from people visiting graves, and I will [play] detective to find out who the recipes belonged to," she said.</p><p>Grant then learns about the recipe, hunting down as much information as she can about the deceased.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"If the recipe doesn't have a name, I will contact the cemetery or local association, where I can find their obituary," the librarian said. "When I find their next of kin, I will <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach out to the family</a> and explain what I am planning to do."</p><p>Then they chat on the phone to see if it's OK for Grant to make the recipe. She also asks a few questions about the deceased loved one.</p><p>"From there I will cook the recipe to try it and check with the family that it's accurate or if I was missing anything."</p><p>She loves the fact that the recipes are part of the personalization process of headstones.</p><p>"It is a tool to take forward that you get to do yourself, an invitation to remember this person and eat <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the food</a> they enjoyed in their life," she said.</p><p>"I think I'll put mine on," Grant said of her own headstone one day. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>That way, her family "could think of the memory of us cooking it together," she said. </p>
