<p>The author of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new book</a> about William Shakespeare is claiming that the works of the famed playwright were actually written by a Black, Jewish woman. </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Real-Shakespeare-Emilia-Bassano-Willoughby/dp/1399035371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>The book</u></a>, titled, "The Real Shakespeare: Emilia Bassano Willoughby" by Irene Coslet, argues that Shakespeare was actually Emilia Bassano, a Jewish, dark-skinned woman who was an English poet during the Elizabethan period. </p><p>The Amazon description for the book, which says it is set to be released March 30, questions if Shakespeare was indeed "a white man from Stratford."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-turns-out-6-7-has-history-goes-back-medieval-times" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DAVID MARCUS: TURNS OUT, '6-7' HAS A HISTORY THAT GOES BACK TO MEDIEVAL TIMES</strong></a></p><p>"Debate still rages over the identity of the most beloved poet of all time and ‘father’ of the English-speaking world," the description reads. "Generations of researchers have tried to dismantle the myth of the Stratford man. Now, in this intriguing and well-documented book, Irene Coslet conclusively demonstrates that Shakespeare was a not a man, but a woman: a dark-skinned lady, of Jewish origin, born into a family of Court musicians from Venice, and the mother of the English-speaking world. Her name was Emilia Bassano."</p><p>According to the description, Coslet’s conclusions are based on "re-examination of often-overlooked historical documents, shrewd, chilling, and profound, this volume offers extensive evidence that Emilia was the author of the canon."</p><p>The description also says the book is not just about the debate over whom the writings of Shakespeare should be attributed to, but "about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/womens-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the condition of women</a> at the time Shakespeare was writing. It explains that feminism already existed in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. It reveals not only that Shakespeare was a woman, but also that she defended women. It reintegrates Emilia in the context of the time, for example, by exploring the relationship between Emilia and Queen Elizabeth I."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/st-paul-pastor-denounces-anti-ice-agitators-who-disrupted-church-service-says-were-here-worship-jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ST PAUL PASTOR DENOUNCES ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO DISRUPTED CHURCH SERVICE, SAYS 'WE'RE HERE TO WORSHIP JESUS'</u></strong></a></p><p>Shakespeare, who lived from 1564 to 1616, is perhaps the most famous writer in the English language. His poetry and plays continue to be taught and performed centuries after his death.</p><p>Given his fame and the depth of his work, his life has been the subject of extensive analysis, leading at times to conspiracy theories that he was a fraud or was a pen name for another person.</p><p>Historical records indicate Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway at the age of 18, and had three children with her, Susanna, Hamnet and Judith. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a> reached out to Coslet’s publisher for comment. </p>
