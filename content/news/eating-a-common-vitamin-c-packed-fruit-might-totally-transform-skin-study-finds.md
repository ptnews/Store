<p>Eating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more vitamin C</a> may do more than boost immunity this winter — it could also strengthen skin from the inside out, according to a new study.</p><p>Researchers from the University of Otago in New Zealand found that people who increased their vitamin C intake by eating two kiwis a day for eight weeks showed notable increases in their skin's vitamin C levels, along with signs of improved skin density and cellular renewal — both of which are linked to collagen production.</p><p>Vitamin C from food travels through the bloodstream into the skin, boosting collagen-related markers and skin renewal, the researchers said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/common-kitchen-staples-could-transform-health-unexpected-ways-studies-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COMMON KITCHEN STAPLES COULD TRANSFORM YOUR HEALTH IN UNEXPECTED WAYS, STUDIES SHOW</strong></a></p><p>"We were surprised by the tight correlation between plasma vitamin C levels and those in the skin," lead author Margreet Vissers said in a university news release. </p><p>"This was much more marked than in any other organ we have investigated."</p><p>"Our study shows that the skin is extremely good at absorbing vitamin C from the blood circulation," she added.</p><p>The study is the first to show that vitamin C delivered through the bloodstream makes its way into all layers of the skin and is associated with measurable improvements in skin function, according to Vissers.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/two-fruits-day-can-boost-gut-health-fight-cancer-risk-doctor-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TWO OF THESE FRUITS A DAY CAN BOOST GUT HEALTH, FIGHT CANCER RISK, DOCTOR SAYS</strong></a></p><p>Twenty-four healthy adults in New Zealand and Germany took part in an eight-week dietary intervention. During that time, they ate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two kiwis a day,</a> according to the research paper, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology in October. </p><p>The scientists measured vitamin C levels in the blood and skin before and after the intervention — and used imaging and lab tests to assess changes in skin density and cell renewal.</p><p>After eight weeks, participants saw skin density rise by nearly 50%, skin cell renewal increase by about 30% and skin vitamin C levels climb substantially, according to the study.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Healthy adults should aim for about 250 milligrams of vitamin C per day to maintain adequate levels in the blood plasma — the liquid portion of the blood that carries nutrients throughout the body — the researchers said. </p><p>They recommend eating it regularly because the body does not store vitamin C, according to the news release. </p><p>While the study focused on kiwifruit, they said similar benefits are expected from other vitamin C–rich foods, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/eating-one-type-fruit-could-lower-depression-risk-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including citrus fruits,</a> berries, bell peppers and broccoli.</p><p>Vitamin C is known for playing a key role in collagen production, which is why it is frequently used in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skincare products,</a> but the nutrient is water-soluble and does not penetrate the skin's outer barrier efficiently, Vissers noted.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</strong></a></p><p>Dr. Brian Toy, a board-certified dermatologist at Providence Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, California, said the findings are interesting — but noted the study did not show improvements in skin elasticity or protection from ultraviolet (UV) damage.</p><p>"Because the improvement in density was on a cellular level, any cosmetic improvement would be difficult to appreciate with the naked eye," Toy told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Toy, who is also a clinical professor at the University of Southern California and was not involved in the research, added that the study was small and focused on people who already had low vitamin C levels.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>"If a patient suffers from low vitamin C, dietary changes and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vitamins-supplements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supplement use</a> would be advised regardless," Toy said.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food alone</a> likely won't replace traditional skincare or result in dramatic cosmetic changes, the findings add to growing evidence that diet can influence skin health, experts say.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The research</a> was partially funded by Zespri International, a major kiwifruit producer. </p><p>Toy noted that industry-funded research is common and said the Journal of Investigative Dermatology is a reputable, peer-reviewed publication.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the study's authors for comment.</p>
