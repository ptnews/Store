<p>Dozens of agitators packed the Minnesota Capitol on Tuesday, their chants echoing through the halls as tension over federal immigration enforcement boiled into a standoff just feet from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/gubernatorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gov. Tim Walz’s office</a>.</p><p>The protest comes amid a broader wave of demonstrations following recent fatal encounters involving <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal immigration agents</a> in Minneapolis, with activists calling for accountability and changes to enforcement policies.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, around 200 agitators gathered outside Walz’s office inside the Capitol building, shouting, "ICE out now!" and "Do your job!"</p><p>Before the demonstration, organizers said they planned to slowly march toward the governor’s doors, a move that remained peaceful.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minn-antifa-member-claims-hes-on-run-after-calling-armed-men-confront-immigration-officials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINN.

Charges. When do we want it? Now," and "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/immigrant-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No one is illegal</a>… power to the people."</p><p>Some held signs reading "Justice for Good," featuring a photo of Renee Good, who was shot and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/dhs-probes-whether-agents-killed-va-nurse-accidental-discharge-minneapolis-ice-raid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killed by a federal officer</a> earlier this month.

He said he urged the border czar to end Operation Metro Surge, arguing it creates fear and strains local police. Frey said the city "will not enforce federal immigration laws" and stressed public safety must be built on "community trust."</p>
