<p>Independent journalist Nick Shirley says exposing government fraud has made him a target, and now he’s turning his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus to California</a>.</p><p>Shirley gained national attention after releasing videos he says expose fraud in Minnesota.
