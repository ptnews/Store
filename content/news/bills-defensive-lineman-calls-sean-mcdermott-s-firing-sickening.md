"The best coach I’ve ever been around."</p><p>Phillips joined the Bills for his third stint in the middle of the 2024 season. He played for the Dallas Cowboys for two games before he was released and re-signed with the Bills. Phillips played in 11 games this season but his year was cut short due to an ankle injury.</p><p>McDermott was the head coach in each of Phillips’ stints with the Bills.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bills-fire-head-coach-sean-mcdermott" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILLS FIRE HEAD COACH SEAN MCDERMOTT</strong></a></p><p>Buffalo will embark on its first head-coaching search since the 2017 offseason.</p><p>"Sean has done an admirable job of leading our football team for the past 9 seasons," team owner Terry Pegula said in a statement. "But I feel we are in need of a new structure within our leadership to give this organization the best opportunity to take our team to the next level. We owe that to our players and to Bills Mafia.</p><p>"Sean helped change the mindset of this organization and was instrumental in the Bills becoming a perennial playoff team. I respect all the work, loyalty and attention to detail he showed for this team and the community. I wish Sean, Jamie and his family all the best."</p><p>McDermott had one losing season at the helm. However, he was never able to guide Buffalo to a Super Bowl appearance.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
