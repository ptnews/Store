<p>MILAN (AP) — Valentino Garavani, the jet-set Italian designer whose <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/style-and-beauty/modeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-glamour gowns</a> — often in his trademark shade of "Valentino red" — were fashion show staples for nearly half a century, has died at home in Rome, his foundation announced Monday. He was 93.</p><p>"Valentino Garavani was not only a constant guide and inspiration for all of us, but a true source of light, creativity and vision,″ the foundation founded by Valentino and his partner Giancarlo Giammetti said in a statement posted on social media.</p><p>Universally known by his first name, Valentino was adored by generations of royals, first ladies and movie stars, from Jackie Kennedy Onassis to Julia Roberts and Queen Rania of Jordan, who swore the designer always made them look and feel their best.</p><p>"I know what women want," he once remarked. "They want to be beautiful."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Though Italian-born and despite maintaining his atelier in Rome, he mostly unveiled his collections in Paris, and spoke French with his Italian partner Giammetti, an entrepreneur.</p><p>Alessandro Michele, the current creative director of the Valentino fashion house, wrote in Instagram that he continues to feel Valentino’s "gaze" as he works on the next collection, which will be presented March 12 in Rome, departing from the usual venue of Paris. Michele remembered Valentino as "a man who expanded the limits of the possible" and possessing "a rare delicacy, with a silent rigor and a limitless love for beauty.’'</p><p>Another of Valentino’s successors, Pierpaolo Piccoli, placed a broken heart emoji under the announcement of his death. Former supermodel <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cindy-crawford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cindy Crawford</a> wrote that she was "heartbroken," and called Valentino "a true master of his craft.’'</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/brigitte-bardot-hollywood-icon-animal-rights-activist-dead-91" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BRIGITTE BARDOT, HOLLYWOOD ICON AND ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST, DEAD AT 91</strong></a></p><p>Condolences also came in from the family of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/obituary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late designer Giorgio Armani</a>, who died in September at the age of 91, and Donatella Versace, who posted two photos of Valentino, saying "he will forever be remembered for his art.’'</p><p>Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni remembered Valentino as "an indisputable maestro of eternal style and elegance of Italian high fashion."</p><p>Never one for edginess or statement dressing, Valentino made precious few fashion faux-pas throughout his nearly half-century-long career, which stretched from his early days in Rome in the 1960s through to his retirement in 2008.</p><p>His fail-safe designs made Valentino the king of the red carpet, the go-to man for A-listers’ awards ceremony needs. His sumptuous gowns have graced countless <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/oscars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academy Awards</a>, notably in 2001, when Roberts wore a vintage black and white column to accept her best actress statue. Cate Blanchett also wore Valentino — a one-shouldered number in butter-yellow silk — when she won the Oscar for best supporting actress in 2004.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/elizabeth-taylors-close-friend-reveals-which-her-seven-husbands-the-best-bed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ELIZABETH TAYLOR'S CLOSE FRIEND REVEALS WHICH OF HER SEVEN HUSBANDS WAS 'THE BEST IN BED'</strong></a></p><p>Valentino was also behind the long-sleeved lace dress Jacqueline Kennedy wore for her wedding to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1968. Kennedy and Valentino were close friends for decades, and for a spell the one-time U.S. first lady wore almost exclusively Valentino.</p><p>He was also close to Diana, Princess of Wales, who often donned his sumptuous gowns.</p><p>Beyond his signature orange-tinged shade of red, other Valentino trademarks included bows, ruffles, lace and embroidery; in short, feminine, flirty embellishments that added to the dresses’ beauty and hence to that of the wearers.</p><p>Perpetually tanned and always impeccably dressed, Valentino shared the lifestyle of his jet-set patrons. In addition to his 152-foot (46-meter) yacht and an art collection including works by Picasso and Miro, the couturier owned a 17th-century chateau near Paris with a garden said to boast more than a million roses.</p><p>Valentino and his longtime partner Giammetti flitted among their homes — which also included places in New York, London, Rome, Capri and Gstaad, Switzerland — traveling with their pack of pugs. The pair regularly received A-list friends and patrons, including Madonna and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gwyneth-paltrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>.</p><p>"When I see somebody and unfortunately she’s relaxed and running around in jogging trousers and without any makeup ... I feel very sorry," the designer told RTL television in a 2007 interview. "For me, woman is like a beautiful, beautiful flower bouquet. She has always to be sensational, always to please, always to be perfect, always to please the husband, the lover, everybody. Because we are born to show ourselves always at our best."</p><p>Valentino was born into a well-off family in the northern Italian town of Voghera on May 11, 1932. He said it was his childhood love of cinema that set him down the fashion path.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

He founded the house of Valentino on Rome’s Via Condotti in 1959.</p><p>From the beginning, Giammetti was by his side, handling the business aspect while Valentino used his natural charm to build a client base among the world’s rich and fabulous.</p><p>After some early financial setbacks — Valentino’s tastes were always lavish, and the company spent with abandon — the brand took off.</p><p>Early fans included Italian screen sirens Gina Lollobrigida and Sophia Loren, as well as Hollywood stars Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn. Legendary American Vogue editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland also took the young designer under her wing.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/brigitte-bardots-final-days-before-death-91-tributes-french-icon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BRIGITTE BARDOT’S FINAL DAYS BEFORE HER DEATH AT 91 AS TRIBUTES POUR IN FOR FRENCH ICON</strong></a></p><p>Over the years, Valentino’s empire expanded as the designer added ready-to-wear, menswear and accessories lines to his stable. Valentino and Giammetti sold the label to an Italian holding company for an estimated $300 million in 1998. Valentino would remain in a design role for another decade.</p><p>In 2007, the couturier feted his 45th anniversary in fashion with a 3-day-long blowout in Rome, capped with a grand ball in the Villa Borghese gallery.</p><p>Valentino retired in 2008 and was briefly replaced by fellow Italian Alessandra Facchinetti, who had stepped into Tom Ford’s shoes at Gucci before being sacked after two seasons.</p><p>Facchinetti’s tenure at Valentino proved equally short. As early as her first show for the label, rumors swirled that she was already on her way out, and just about one year after she was hired, Facchinetti was indeed replaced by two longtime accessories designers at the brand, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli.</p><p>Chiuri left to helm Dior in 2016, and Piccioli continued to lead the house through a golden period that drew on the launch of the Rockstud pump with Chiuri and his own signature color, a shade of fuchsia called Pink PP. He left the house in 2024, later joining Balenciaga, and has been replaced by Michele, who revived Gucci’s stars with romantic, genderless styles.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/real-estate/luxury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valentino is owned</a> by Qatar’s Mayhoola, which controls a 70% stake, and the French luxury conglomerate Kering, which owns 30% with an option to take full control in 2028 or 2029. Richard Bellini was named CEO last September.</p><p>A public viewing will be held at the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation on Wednesday and Thursday, and a funeral will be held Friday in the Basilica di Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in central Rome.</p><p>Barchfield is a former Associated Press writer.
