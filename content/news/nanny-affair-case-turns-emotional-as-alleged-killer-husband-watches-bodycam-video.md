<p>Brendan Banfield appeared visibly emotional in court Wednesday as jurors watched <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">police body camera video</a> from the night his wife was killed, wiping away tears as a police detective walked the jury through the video.</p><p>Det. Zachary Beckner returned to the stand during the defense's case to discuss video recorded by responding officers. As the video played in the courtroom, Banfield shook his head, sniffled and used tissues to wipe his eyes while seated.</p><p>The video showed officers’ response to the home where Banfield’s wife, Christine Banfield, was found stabbed in February 2023. Another man, Joseph Ryan, was also killed.</p><p>Banfield is charged with aggravated murder in the February 2023 killings of Christine and Ryan inside their home in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herndon, Virginia</a>, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C. Prosecutors allege he orchestrated the killings to cover up his relationship with the family’s au pair, Juliana Peres Magalhães. Banfield has pleaded not guilty.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-nannys-jailhouse-letters-reveal-conflicting-loyalties-love-triangle-murder-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>VIRGINIA NANNY’S JAILHOUSE LETTERS REVEAL CONFLICTING LOYALTIES IN LOVE TRIANGLE MURDER TRIAL</u></strong></a></p><p>The emotional courtroom moment came as the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defense continued presenting its case</a>, which has included efforts to challenge forensic evidence and to emphasize Banfield’s reaction in the immediate aftermath of his wife’s death.</p><p>Jurors watched as the bodycam video was replayed.
