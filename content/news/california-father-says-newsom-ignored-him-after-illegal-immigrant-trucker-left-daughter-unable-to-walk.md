<p>A California man whose daughter was left unable to walk or speak after a crash involving an illegal migrant truck driver says California Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gavin-newsom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gavin Newsom</a> has ignored his repeated pleas for help, for years.</p><p>"When Dalilah's accident first happened, I reached out to the governor's office, via phone as well as email. I received nothing back at all," Marcus Coleman told "The Will Cain Show" Tuesday.</p><p>According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-truck-driver-fatal-california-crash-never-license-dot-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the crash was caused</a> by Partap Singh, an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal immigrant</a> from India who was driving a commercial 18-wheeler. Singh reportedly failed to stop in a construction zone, triggering a multi-vehicle pileup, hitting the Coleman family’s vehicle.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/california-father-says-newsom-ignored-pleas-after-migrant-truckers-crash-left-daughter-critically-injured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critically injured</a> in the crash was then 5-year-old Dalilah Coleman. She spent three weeks in a coma and was left with severe, life-altering injuries.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/suspect-accused-causing-massive-fatal-pileup-illegal-immigrant-obtained-cdl-new-york-feds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SUSPECT ACCUSED OF CAUSING MASSIVE FATAL PILEUP WAS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WHO OBTAINED CDL IN NEW YORK: FEDS</strong></a></p><p>Now 7 years old, Dalilah is nonverbal and relearning how to walk, requiring intensive and ongoing therapy.</p><p>Coleman told Fox News host Will Cain that his family has been left hanging in their requests for help, saying they were denied <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/fema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Security benefits</a> and other forms of government assistance to cover Dalilah’s treatments.</p><p>"It’s just kind of left up to us to sit there and take care of what we need to take care of," he said.</p><p>"I'm here… trying to make ends meet to satisfy her needs. And even then, we're still falling short and there's nobody there to help us with it," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/duffy-vows-were-not-going-take-lying-down-after-court-blocks-cdl-restrictions-illegal-migrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DUFFY VOWS 'WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS LYING DOWN' AFTER COURT BLOCKS CDL RESTRICTIONS FOR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS</strong></a></p><p>A truck driver himself, Coleman expressed frustration with California’s policies that allow foreign-born truck drivers to obtain commercial driver’s licenses (CDL) with what he described as minimal regulation, calling the practice "gross negligence."</p><p>Concerns over California’s CDL standards have drawn national attention, including from Trump administration officials like Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who commented about Dalilah’s case on Monday.</p><p>"California’s weak leadership is failing Americans like Dalilah every day," Duffy said on X.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/illinois-father-says-pritzker-shows-indifference-his-daughter-being-killed-illegal-immigrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ILLINOIS FATHER SAYS PRITZKER SHOWS 'INDIFFERENCE' TO HIS DAUGHTER BEING KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT</strong></a></p><p>Dalilah’s father echoed that criticism, accusing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/gubernatorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California leadership</a> of not doing enough for his daughter and prioritizing political interests over the safety of their constituents.</p><p>"I think they're trying to do what's going to favor them in the long run, no matter how many people it hurts," he said.</p><p>Coleman said the only acknowledgment they’ve seen from Newsom came in the form of a social media post accusing President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> and DHS Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristi-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Noem</a> of politicizing the tragedy – a message he says "totally neglected" his daughter’s suffering.</p><p>He argued that, as governor, Newsom is responsible for addressing incidents like Dalilah’s and shared a message for the California leader.</p><p>"Pay attention to your people here in California. We're the ones that should matter. I shouldn't have to be reaching out to anybody else to help us when he's here in California… He should have handled this," Coleman said.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Gov. Newsom's office for comment and did not receive a response.</p><p>In September 2025, Newsom's office argued responsibility for the crash rests with the federal government, not the state, and said the following in a statement to Fox News Digital:</p><p>"Our hearts go out to the Coleman family."</p>
