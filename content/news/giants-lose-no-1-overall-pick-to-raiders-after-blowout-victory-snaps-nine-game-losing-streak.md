<p>Jaxson Dart and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Giants</a> finally got that winning feeling back on game day, but it came at a price. </p><p>With their 34-10 victory against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/las-vegas-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas Raiders</a>, they relinquished control of the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Raiders now own the pick heading into their regular-season finale in Week 18. </p><p>The Giants are 3-13 on the season, while the Raiders move to 2-14. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>New York entered this game owning the worst record in the league when accounting for strength of schedule as well. If they lost to the Raiders, the Giants would've solidified the No. 1 pick.</p><p>But, of course, no team is trying to lose on game day and the Giants showcased that right in the first quarter after a clutch interception by linebacker Bobby Okereke as Geno Smith and the Raiders’ offense were moving in the Giants’ red zone.</p><p>Five plays later, the Giants turned the turnover into the first points of the game, as Devin Singletary scored from one yard out to make it 7-0.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2-nfl-division-titles-line-week-18-after-crucial-losses-tighten-playoff-picture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2 NFL DIVISION TITLES ON THE LINE IN WEEK 18 AFTER CRUCIAL LOSSES TIGHTEN PLAYOFF PICTURE</strong></a></p><p>The Raiders would respond with a field goal on the ensuing drive, but Dart, the rookie who has shined despite the Giants’ results this season, wanted to get back into the end zone.
