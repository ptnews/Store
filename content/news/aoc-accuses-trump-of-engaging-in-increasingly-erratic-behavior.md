He is not leaving this race. He is in this race, and I support him," she <a href="https://x.com/KevinJFrey/status/1810448869202808885" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said at the time.</a></p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump declared</a> in a Truth Social post, "The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take."</p><p>"P.S., I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!" <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115825378093317232" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">he added.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-pitches-cognitive-tests-leaders-questions-harris-walz-newsom-could-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP PITCHES COGNITIVE TESTS FOR LEADERS, QUESTIONS IF HARRIS, WALZ, NEWSOM COULD PASS</strong></a></p><p>In a Truth Social <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114738685142153877" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post last year,</a> Trump referred to Ocasio-Cortez as "one of the ‘dumbest’ people in Congress."</p>
