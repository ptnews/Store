<p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Saturday called President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> comments about NATO allies’ role in Afghanistan "unacceptable," pushing back against suggestions they "stayed a little back" from the front lines.</p><p>"Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, NATO activated Article 5 for the first and only time in its history: an extraordinary act of solidarity toward the United States," Meloni wrote on X.</p><p>"In that massive operation against those who fueled terrorism, Italy responded immediately alongside its allies, deploying thousands of troops and taking full responsibility for Regional Command West, one of the most significant operational areas of the entire international mission," she said.</p><p>Meloni explained that Italy’s nearly two decades of involvement in Afghanistan came at a significant cost, with 53 Italian soldiers killed and more than 700 wounded during combat operations, security missions and training programs for Afghan forces.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-us-should-have-tested-nato-invoking-article-5-over-border-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP SAYS US SHOULD HAVE TESTED NATO BY INVOKING ARTICLE 5 OVER BORDER SECURITY</strong></a></p><p>"For this reason, statements that minimize the contribution of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NATO countries</a> in Afghanistan are unacceptable, especially if they come from an allied Nation," she added. </p><p>"Italy and the United States are bound by a solid friendship, founded on a shared community of values and historical collaboration, which is even more necessary in the face of the many current challenges. But friendship requires respect, a fundamental condition for continuing to ensure the solidarity at the heart of the Atlantic Alliance."</p><p>Trump has repeatedly questioned NATO allies’ reliability, including whether they would come to the United States’ aid if ever called upon.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nato-chief-praises-trump-davos-says-he-forced-europe-step-up-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NATO CHIEF PRAISES TRUMP AT DAVOS, SAYS HE FORCED EUROPE TO ‘STEP UP’ ON DEFENSE</strong></a></p><p>He unsettled U.S. allies across Europe, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-fires-back-trump-nato-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downplaying their contributions</a> in Afghanistan during an interview with FOX Business host Maria Bartiromo at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>"We’ve never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them," Trump said of NATO. "You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this and that. And they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines."</p><p>Trump later appeared to soften his remarks in a Saturday post on Truth Social, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hails-great-very-brave-uk-soldiers-after-slamming-nato-allies-afghanistan-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praising the sacrifices</a> of British troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>"The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America! In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. It’s a bond too strong to ever be broken. The U.K. Military, with tremendous Heart and Soul, is second to none (except for the U.S.A.!). We love you all, and always will!" he wrote.</p><p>Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., also highlighted the broader international toll of the war, citing the sacrifices of 31 allied nations that fought alongside U.S. forces in Afghanistan.</p><p>He thanked those countries for answering the call after Sept. 11, noting that 159 troops from Canada, 90 from France, 62 from Germany, 44 from Poland and 43 from Denmark were among those killed in the conflict.</p>
