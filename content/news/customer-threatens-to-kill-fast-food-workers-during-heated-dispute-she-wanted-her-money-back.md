There was never any refusal to resolve the issue," the post added. </p><p>"When the threats began, the refund was completed and the individual was removed from the property."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>Arianna Tarbox, an employee at the restaurant, told FOX 4 Kansas City the customer threatened to "get [us] shot up."</p><p>"She wanted her [expletive] money back," Tarbox said. </p><p>Paul's Drive In co-owner Amanda Fulbright told FOX 4 the behavior happens "pretty often" in the service industry. </p><p>"People who work everywhere, whether it's a restaurant or any service industry — they're here to serve you.
