<p>A federal judge in Washington state on Friday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing key parts of an executive order that sought to change how states administer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal elections</a>, ruling the president lacked authority to apply those provisions to Washington and Oregon.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/federal-judges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. District Judge</a> John Chun held that several provisions of Executive Order 14248 violated the separation of powers and exceeded the president’s authority.</p><p>"As stated by the Supreme Court, although the Constitution vests the executive power in the President, ‘[i]n the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker,’" <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.346612/gov.uscourts.wawd.346612.126.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Chun wrote</u></a> in his 75-page ruling.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-trumps-birthright-citizenship-executive-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST TRUMP'S BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP EXECUTIVE ORDER</strong></a></p><p>White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital in a statement: "President Trump cares deeply about the integrity of our elections and his executive order takes lawful actions to ensure election security. This is not the final say on the matter and the Administration expects ultimate victory on the issue."</p><p>Washington and Oregon filed a lawsuit in April contending the executive order signed by President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> in March violated the Constitution by attempting to set rules for how states conduct elections, including ballot counting, voter registration and voting equipment.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-targets-noncitizens-voter-rolls-doj-election-integrity-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOJ TARGETS NONCITIZENS ON VOTER ROLLS AS PART OF TRUMP ELECTION INTEGRITY PUSH</strong></a></p><p>"Today’s ruling is a huge victory for voters in Washington and Oregon, and for the rule of law," Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in response to the Jan. 9 ruling, according to The Associated Press. "The court enforced the long-standing constitutional rule that only States and Congress can regulate elections, not the Election Denier-in-Chief."</p><p><a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14248-preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-american-elections" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Executive Order 14248</u></a> directed federal agencies to require documentary proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms and sought to require that absentee and mail-in ballots be received by Election Day in order to be counted.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The order</a> also instructed the attorney general to take enforcement action against states that include such ballots in their final vote tallies if they arrive after that deadline.</p><p>"We oppose requirements that suppress eligible voters and will continue to advocate for inclusive and equitable access to registration while protecting the integrity of the process. The U.S. Constitution guarantees that all qualified voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote and to have their votes counted," said Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs in a <a href="https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/wa-or-sue-trump-protect-election-integrity-presidential-interference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>statement issued</u></a> when the lawsuit was filed last year.</p><p>"We will work with the Washington Attorney General's Office to defend our constitutional authority and ensure Washington's elections remain secure, fair, and accessible," Hobbs added.</p><p>Chun noted in his ruling that Washington and Oregon do not certify election results on Election Day, a practice shared by every U.S. state and territory, which allows them to count mail-in ballots received after Election Day as long as the ballots were postmarked on or before that day and arrived before certification under state law.</p>
