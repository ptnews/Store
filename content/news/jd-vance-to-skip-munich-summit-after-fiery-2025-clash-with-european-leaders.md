<p>Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jd-vance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD Vance</a> will not attend the Munich Security Conference in 2026, Fox News Digital has learned. </p><p>The move comes after Vance attended the conference in 2025 and issued some harsh words for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/federal-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European leaders</a> — prompting some backlash from allies on the other side of the pond. </p><p>A source familiar with Vance’s plans confirmed to Fox News Digital that Vance would not participate in the conference in 2026, but no reason was provided for his absence. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-15/vance-to-skip-munich-conference-where-he-roiled-allies-last-year" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a> first reported that Vance would not attend the conference. </p><p>The 2026 conference will be held in February in Munich. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/european-allies-working-plan-us-acts-acquiring-greenland-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EUROPEAN ALLIES WORKING ON PLAN IF US ACTS ON ACQUIRING GREENLAND: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>Vance's absence comes as he's publicly been more focused on domestic issues like fraud cases in Minnesota recently, while President Donald Trump and Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a> appear to be spearheading the administration's foreign policy agenda. </p><p>Meanwhile, Vance in 2025 cautioned that Russia and China don't pose as great a threat to European nations as the "threat from within," in regard to issues like censorship and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal immigration</a>. Likewise, Vance claimed that European voters didn’t endorse opening the "floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants."<strong> </strong></p><p>"To many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/national-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">misinformation and disinformation</a>, who simply don’t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election," Vance said at the 2025 conference, which was held in February. </p><p>European leaders challenged the remarks, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said shortly after Vance delivered the statement that he perceived the statements as a comparison to "conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-greenland-push-escalates-gop-lawmaker-moves-make-americas-51st-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP'S GREENLAND PUSH ESCALATES AS GOP LAWMAKER MOVES TO MAKE IT AMERICA'S 51ST STATE</strong></a></p><p>"That is unacceptable, and it is not the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Europe and not the democracy</a> in which I live and am currently campaigning," Pistorius said. </p><p>Meanwhile, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre claimed that Vance was off base on his comments about immigration in Europe.</p><p>"He speaks as though we are not focused on immigration in Europe," Gahr Støre said. "I mean, this is the big theme in every country, that we want to have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control of our borders</a>."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to conference officials for comment on Vance's absence and has not yet received a reply. </p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p>
