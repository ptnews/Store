"I just don’t want to feel this way anymore. It’s torture. I love you more than anything." </p><p>In a letter addressed to Banfield’s mother and sent when she was in jail, Magalhães offered to take the blame for the alleged crimes in an effort to shield Banfield. </p><p>"I’d give my life for his and I would never do anything to hurt him or against him," Magalhães wrote. "Whatever they’re saying, whatever they want to believe, I don’t care.

"No strength, anymore. No courage. No hope. It feels like a personal hell in life. Painful, torture, disturbing." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SEND US A TIP HERE</u></strong></a></p><p>The au pair also testified on cross-examination that after Banfield’s family stopped funding her life in jail, various unnamed news producers have stepped up to cover her commissary and other needs in exchange for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>rights to her story</u></a>.</p><p>"Let’s work together to achieve more things," Magalhães wrote in a letter to a friend on Dec. 13, 2024. "After awhile, when I’m back home, I’ll [hire] a producer and write a book with my story, [or] even a movie – make money, right?" </p><p>Magalhães later wrote to her friend regarding a potential <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>deal with Netflix</u></a>, in which she was looking to negotiate a payment in exchange for her interviews and input on a documentary about the case.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/affluent-virginia-husband-nanny-charged-murders-mansion-love-triangle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>AFFLUENT VIRGINIA HUSBAND, NANNY CHARGED WITH MURDERS IN MANSION LOVE TRIANGLE</u></strong></a></p><p>"My whole life will be exposed to everyone, and they’re going to be making a lot of money off of it," Magalhães wrote. "We deserve something." </p><p>Netflix did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. </p><p>Upon being pressed by Banfield's defense, Magalhães clarified that she intended to use the money to support <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/brazil" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>her family in Brazil</u></a>.</p><p>"My whole point was about helping them, because I can't," Magalhães testified. "That was when I was working before. And if they can have someone to help them, I want them to have it." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? FIND MORE ON THE TRUE CRIME HUB</u></strong></a></p><p>On Tuesday, Magalhães testified that she was 21 when she began working as the family’s nanny in October 2021, with the relationship between her and Banfield turning sexual roughly 10 months later. She revealed that Banfield had expressed interest in a marriage with her, but would have to "get rid of his wife," testifying that the married father conceded that divorce was not an option due to the couple’s finances and custody of their young daughter. </p><p>Magalhães testified that Banfield concocted an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>elaborate plan</u></a> to create a fake profile for his wife on a fetish website, in an effort to proposition men to enter the home so Banfield could stage a fake home invasion and murder Christine. Ultimately, the pair decided on Ryan. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxTrueCrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X</u></strong></a></p><p>"Brendan created the narrative that Christine desperately wanted to be raped," prosecutor Jenna Sands explained in her opening statement. "Posing as Christine, he told Joe what to do: Come to the home in Reston. The door will be unlocked. Christine will be asleep in bed. Come straight upstairs, cut off her clothing, tie her, rape her. Simple and fun." </p><p>Throughout direct examination, Magalhães described – in graphic detail – how she took the couple’s child and waited in her car for Ryan to arrive, where she then called Banfield to alert him. The pair left the child with her iPad in the basement and entered the married couple’s master bedroom to find Ryan on top of Christine. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"When I got to the bedroom, Brendan yelled, ‘Police officer,’ and Christine's first reaction – it was the first time I heard her say anything at that point – and she yelled back at Brendan, saying, ‘Brendan, he has a knife,’ and that's when Brendan first <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>shot Joe</u></a>," Magalhães said Tuesday. </p><p>Banfield then shot Ryan with his service weapon and stabbed his wife while Magalhães held a gun he had purchased a month before the alleged killing, according to prosecutors. </p><p>Banfield's attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. </p><p>If convicted, Banfield faces the possibility of life in prison for his alleged role in the two killings. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/affluent-virginia-suburb-rocked-trial-begins-ex-federal-agent-husband-nanny-love-triangle-murders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>His trial is expected</u></a> to last four weeks, with court sessions starting at 10 a.m. each day and running Monday through Thursday, according to court administrators.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report. </i></p>
