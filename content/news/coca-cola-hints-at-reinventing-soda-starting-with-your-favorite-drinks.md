"If you look at the two biggest growing trademarks in the U.S. last year, it was the Coke trademark, basically driven by Coke Zero and Diet Coke … and [the] Fairlife Core Power protein [drink]."</p><p>Coca-Cola owns Fairlife, a brand that's surged in popularity by offering high levels of protein in its milk and protein shakes.</p><p>"You've got a lot of focus on refreshment and a lot of focus on protein," Quincey said.
