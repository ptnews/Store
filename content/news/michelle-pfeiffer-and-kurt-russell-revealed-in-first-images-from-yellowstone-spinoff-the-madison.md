I've been like working with incredible cast members in all three things that I've done recently. Great directors, great material. However, little did I know my daughter was planning on getting pregnant, which she did successfully," Pfeiffer said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kurt-russell-goldie-hawns-warning-daughter-kate-hudson-surviving-hollywood-fame" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KURT RUSSELL, GOLDIE HAWN’S BLUNT WARNING TO DAUGHTER KATE HUDSON ABOUT SURVIVING HOLLYWOOD FAME</strong></a></p><p>"And, lo and behold, here I am working a lot. So, I think I'm going to have probably most of next year off, which I'm really looking forward to. Look, it's an embarrassment of riches, honestly. It's like, ‘Wah.’ I'm just really wanting my choices and the way I spend my time — whatever time I have left — to spend it meaningfully is what I'm focusing on."</p><p>In the first stills that have been released, Pfeiffer is seen sitting in a wooden rocking chair on a porch. Pfeiffer's character, Stacy Clyburn, is described as the "heart of the family." She is holding a book in the shot.</p><p>Another image shows Pfeiffer holding a coffee mug and wearing an oversized utility jacket in a field.</p><p>In another image, Russell's character, Preston Clyburn, is sitting on a tree stump looking off into the distance.
