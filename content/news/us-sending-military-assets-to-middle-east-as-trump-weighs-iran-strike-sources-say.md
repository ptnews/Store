Transit to the region is expected to take at least a week.</p><p>U.S. military assets from air, land and sea are expected to flow into the region in the coming days and weeks to provide the president with military options should he decide to carry out strikes against Iran, sources said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/g7-threatens-iran-new-sanctions-nationwide-protest-crackdown-killing-thousands" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>G7 THREATENS IRAN WITH NEW SANCTIONS OVER NATIONWIDE PROTEST CRACKDOWN KILLING THOUSANDS</strong></a></p><p>The movements are part of what officials described as a process of "setting the force."</p><p>One well-placed source said if the president decides to carry out military action, "This will be different, more offensive."
