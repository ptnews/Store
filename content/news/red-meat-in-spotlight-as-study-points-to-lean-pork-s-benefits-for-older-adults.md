<p>Red meat is back under the new U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines — and a recent study suggests that lean pork might be especially helpful.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/foods-americans-were-told-avoid-decades-back-under-trumps-new-nutrition-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a> show red meat next to fruit and vegetables — and suggest consuming "a variety of protein foods from animal sources, including eggs, poultry, seafood and red meat."</p><p>The shift in federal guidance comes on the heels of new research examining the impact of lean pork in the diets of adults over 65.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/red-meat-can-help-mood-part-healthy-balanced-diet-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>RED MEAT CAN HELP YOUR MOOD IF PART OF A HEALTHY, BALANCED DIET, STUDY SUGGESTS</u></strong></a></p><p>Researchers studied a group of overweight older adults to determine the impact of lean, minimally processed pork, as described in the January 2026 issue of the journal Current Developments in Nutrition.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The study</a> was funded by the National Pork Checkoff and the Meat Foundation, with the researchers clarifying that the sponsors "had no role in the design of the study [or] the collection, analysis or interpretation of data."</p><p>One group ate a plant-forward diet with pork as the only meat, while the other ate plant-based meals with lentils, beans and chickpeas as protein sources.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/eating-chicken-linked-higher-mortality-rates-observational-study-suggests"><strong><u>EATING CHICKEN LINKED TO HIGHER MORTALITY RATES, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY SUGGESTS</u></strong></a></p><p>The participants who consumed lean pork reported improved insulin sensitivity and better preservation of "good" cholesterol (HDL). They also showed a trend toward less muscle loss during the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight loss</a> process.</p><p>The researchers — including corresponding author Moul Dey, Ph.D., a professor in the School of Health and Human Sciences at South Dakota State University — said their findings "challenge the perception that red meat is broadly unsuitable for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older adults</a>."</p><p>"Including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">familiar foods</a> like red meat (pork), particularly in minimally processed form and within a healthy overall dietary pattern, may provide age-associated health benefits and improve adherence to plant-forward diets in populations where red meat remains popular," the study concluded.</p><p>Not all red meat is nutritionally the same, said Erin Palinski-Wade, a New Jersey-based dietitian.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Red meat "tends to get painted with a very broad brush," Palinski-Wade told Fox News Digital. (She was not affiliated with the new study.)</p><p>"Including lean, minimally processed pork a few times per week can absolutely fit into a healthy, plant-forward eating pattern," she said.</p><p>"Especially when portions stay reasonable and pork is replacing more processed meats, not crowding out foods like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/beantok-trend-goes-viral-wild-gut-health-promises-heres-what-experts-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beans, nuts</a> or fish."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>The key is to think of lean pork as a component of a plate, rather than the star, she said.</p><p>"Aim for about 3–4 ounces cooked and build <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the meal</a> around vegetables, whole grains, pulses, fruit and healthy fats," Palinski-Wade suggested.</p><p>"That might look like a veggie-packed stir-fry with brown rice and a small amount of pork tenderloin, a grain bowl loaded with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/budget-friendly-vegetable-becoming-one-2026s-biggest-food-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roasted vegetables</a> and lentils, plus a few slices of pork loin or soups and stews — where pork adds flavor while beans and vegetables supply most of the volume."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>Though the study is promising, it does not suggest that legumes should be replaced with meat, Palinski-Wade said.</p><p>"Both the plant-only pattern and the pork-plus-plants pattern led to improvements in weight, fasting insulin and functional outcomes," she said. </p><p>Eating more protein can also slow sarcopenia — age-related muscle loss — and stimulate muscle protein synthesis, she said.</p><p>"For older adults, the real takeaway is that pairing high-quality <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/healthiest-red-meats-eat-how-cardiologist-says-prepare-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animal protein</a> like lean pork with plenty of plant foods can make it easier to meet essential amino acid needs while supporting strength, mobility and markers of healthy aging," the expert concluded.</p>
