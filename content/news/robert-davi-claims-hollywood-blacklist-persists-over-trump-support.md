<p>After previously saying that he felt blacklisted by Hollywood due to his support for President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> that began in 2015, Robert Davi this week said he feels like it's continuing "to some extent."</p><p>"It’s still ongoing, but it might be lightening up, I think," the "Die Hard" actor told Raymond Arroyo on his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDWRvdwQbCQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> "Arroyo Grande"</a> podcast. "I don’t know, and it’s among certain elements of the industry. In other words, you’ll never know exactly where the button gets pushed."</p><p>Davi said many times his manager will tell him someone is interested in him for a project, then it doesn’t come through because he suspects "it goes up the flagpole to somebody and then, all of a sudden, it gets wiped out, but it absolutely is because there’s no reason for it." </p><p>But, he said there’s no way of gauging how many projects he’s lost because of his political leanings, especially since he knows there’s some he never even hears about.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tim-allen-says-one-conversation-made-trump-walk-away-from-hollywood-movie-investing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TIM ALLEN SAYS ONE CONVERSATION MADE TRUMP WALK AWAY FROM HOLLYWOOD MOVIE INVESTING</strong></a></p><p>He also revealed that he was twice asked to endorse liberal candidates. </p><p>"In 2016, some execs came to me and said, ‘Hey, if you now support so-and-so, name your ticket, and that happened twice, two different elections," he said, but his quick answer was "Why would I do that?"</p><p>An outspoken conservative, Davi said he gets frustrated with "closeted" conservatives in the industry.</p><p>"If they — and there’s some powerful ones — and if they did come forward, if they had the courage to come forward, it would help many others that are closeted," he said. </p><p>Davi added that people come up to him all the time to tell him that they follow him on social media, and thank him for what he’s been saying.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Invoking Frank Sinatra, he said that if the Rat Pack crooner liked someone, "they had a little bit of influence" because of their connection to him.</p><p>"So <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/influencers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrities do have — even</a> though they want to say celebrities have no [influence], they do. They have some kind of effect on the younger generation, in people that are influenced," he continued. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

"I won’t <i>not </i>go see a film," he explained, adding that his daughter had them watching De Niro’s 2009 movie "Everybody’s Fine" over the holidays, which he said has a "terrific message."</p><p>He joked as he was watching the film he thought, "I forgive him."</p>
