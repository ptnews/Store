<p>Federal authorities were conducting a "massive" investigation in Minnesota on Monday, days after a video posted online by an independent journalist on alleged fraud involving daycare centers. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeland Security</a> Investigations (HSI) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were on the ground in Minneapolis, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X. </p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to DHS, as well as ICE and the FBI. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmakers-probe-sba-loans-linked-to-minnesotas-9b-fraud-scandal-reckless-decision-making" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LAWMAKERS PROBE SBA LOANS LINKED TO MINNESOTA’S $9B FRAUD SCANDAL: 'RECKLESS DECISION MAKING'</strong></a></p><p>A video Noem posted online showed HSI agents questioning someone outside a building, but it was not clear what type of business the person was involved in. </p><p>Another video posted by ICE showed investigators going door-to-door at various sites. </p><p>"The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found. Under the leadership of <a class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1wvb978 r-1loqt21">@Sec_Noem</a>, DHS is working to deliver results," the agency wrote on X. </p><p>Still reeling from a $250M <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraud scheme</a> in which several people have been charged, Minnesota was thrust into the spotlight again this weekend after independent journalist Nick Shirley on Friday posted a 42-minute video on YouTube, documenting visits to several daycare centers in the blue state.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-surges-resources-minnesota-director-patel-calls-250m-fraud-scheme-tip-iceberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FBI SURGES RESOURCES TO MINNESOTA AS DIRECTOR PATEL CALLS $250M FRAUD SCHEME ‘TIP OF A VERY LARGE ICEBERG’</strong></a></p><p>In one clip, Shirley and a man are seen at what appears to be a largely inactive childcare facility. </p><p>The building also displays a misspelled sign reading "Quality Learing Center," even though the center reportedly is supposed to account for 99 children and received roughly $4 million in state funds.</p><p>The video immediately <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-walz-pushes-back-minnesota-fraud-allegations-following-viral-daycare-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparked widespread</a> backlash, drawing criticism of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz from several high-profile figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., Donald Trump Jr. and Elon Musk.</p><p>On Sunday, the White House reposted an X post from Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who called the alleged fraud a "breathtaking failure that has happened under the watch" of Walz.</p><p>During a Sunday appearance on Fox News' "The Big Weekend Show," Shirley said the alleged fraud was "so obvious" that a "kindergartner could figure out that there is fraud going on."</p><p>"Fraud is fraud, and we work too hard simply just to be paying taxes and enabling fraud to be happening," he said. </p><p>Over the weekend, FBI Director <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kash-patel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Kash Patel</u></a> said the agency surged additional personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota as part of an ongoing effort to "dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs."</p><p>At the time of the video's release, Walz was already under heavy fire amid the scandal enveloping his administration that notably included at least $1 billion lost to alleged social services fraud largely tied to Minneapolis' Somali community.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the governor's office for comment, but they did not immediately respond.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Sophia Compton contributed to this report. </i></p>
