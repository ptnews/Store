<p>Liberal comedian <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bill-maher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Maher</a> took a swipe at his "woke" peers in Hollywood who refuse to give him trophies at awards shows.</p><p>On Monday's installment of his "Club Random" podcast, Maher sat down with "Train Dreams" star Joel Edgerton and the two of them bonded over how they're both nominees at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/golden-globes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden Globes</a> (the interview was taped before the ceremony that aired Sunday).</p><p>"How do you feel going in?" Edgerton asked. "To me — and maybe it's because I've always set my ceiling quite low in life. Like, being nominated to me is a win."</p><p>"Sweetheart, I've been nominated for 33 Emmys, and they would never give it to me," Maher responded. "That's not a gag number. That's a real number. It's crazy."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-laughs-celebrities-honoring-renee-good-pins-golden-globes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILL MAHER LAUGHS AT CELEBRITIES HONORING RENEE GOOD WITH PINS AT GOLDEN GLOBES</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-tim-allen-criticize-dei-practices-hampering-creative-process-say-sitcoms-just-got-funny" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILL MAHER, TIM ALLEN CRITICIZE DEI PRACTICES HAMPERING CREATIVE PROCESS, SAYS SITCOMS JUST ‘GOT TO BE FUNNY’</strong></a></p><p>"Obviously, it's something I said. Well, it's everything I said," Maher later joked.</p><p>"It's enough to get the nomination," Edgerton interjected. "But there's something you've said – "</p><p>"Because I speak freely. And this woke town f------ hates that," Maher continued. "And that's okay. I've made my peace with that."</p><p>Maher went on to say that if by "some miracle" he won the award, "I really should be shocked."</p><p>Since 1995, Maher has racked up dozens of Emmy nominations for "Real Time," his previous late-night show "Politically Incorrect," as well as various stand-up specials, though he did win an Emmy as an executive producer for HBO's documentary series "Vice" in 2014, according to his IMDB page.</p><p>Maher attended the Golden Globes on Sunday as a nominee for Best Performance in Stand-Up Comedy on Television. However, he lost the award to British funnyman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ricky-gervais" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricky Gervais</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS</strong></a></p>
