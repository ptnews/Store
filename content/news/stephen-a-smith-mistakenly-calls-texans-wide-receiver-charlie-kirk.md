Smith mistakenly referred to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/houston-and-galveston" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houston Texans</a> wide receiver Christian Kirk as Charlie Kirk Tuesday.</p><p>Smith was talking about Kirk’s big game in the Texans' 30-6 playoff win over the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> during ESPN’s "First Take" when he had a slip of the tongue.</p><p>"We saw Charlie Kirk catch eight receptions for 144 yards," Smith said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>He was quickly corrected and promptly apologized.
