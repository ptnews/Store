That was kind of the weird part," Pitones said. "This is a quiet neighborhood."

Because the investigation spanned multiple jurisdictions and potentially included federal violations, the case was referred to the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, where it remains active.</p><p>Authorities declined further comment, directing additional questions to federal investigators.
