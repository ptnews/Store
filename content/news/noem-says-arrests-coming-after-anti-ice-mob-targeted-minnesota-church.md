They accosted members of our congregation, frightened children, and created a scene marked by intimidation and threat. Such conduct is shameful, unlawful, and will not be tolerated. Invading a church service to disrupt the worship of Jesus — or any other act of worship — is protected by neither the Christian Scriptures nor the laws of this nation."</p><p><i>Fox News’ Greg Wehner, Jasmine Baehr and David Spunt contributed to this report.</i> </p>
