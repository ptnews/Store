<p>A longtime <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Republican</a> who sits on Congress' powerful tax-writing committee is retiring after 20 years on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., announced on Tuesday that he will not be seeking re-election, ending a two-decade-long career in Washington at the age of 74.</p><p>He's the 28th Republican to join what appears to be a mass exodus from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House of Representatives</a> after the current term. Twenty-one House Democrats will also not seek re-election to the chamber.</p><p>Buchanan said in a statement that it was the honor of a lifetime to serve his southwest Florida congressional district.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-unveils-plan-cut-deficit-1-trillion-second-big-beautiful-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOP UNVEILS PLAN TO CUT DEFICIT BY $1 TRILLION WITH SECOND 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'</strong></a></p><p>"Every achievement worth doing began with listening to my constituents and fighting for their priorities. I came to Congress to solve problems, to fight for working families and to help ensure this country remains a place where opportunity is available to everyone willing to work for it," Buchanan said.</p><p>"After <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 years of service,</a> I believe it’s the right time to pass the torch and begin a new chapter in my life."</p><p>Buchanan spent nearly all of his time in Congress as a member of the House Ways &amp; Means Committee, a powerful panel that oversees a variety of issues including tax policy.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/headed-exits-why-3-dozen-house-members-arent-running-re-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HEADED FOR THE EXITS: WHY 3-DOZEN HOUSE MEMBERS AREN'T RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION</strong></a></p><p>He was in contention to chair the committee after Republicans retook the House of Representatives in November 2022 but ultimately lost the gavel to current Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo.</p><p>Since then, Buchanan has served as the committee's vice chair and chairman of its subcommittee on health.</p><p>Before he leaves office, he's still likely to play a key role as Republicans in Congress eye another "big, beautiful bill" via the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget reconciliation process.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-lamalfas-death-further-shrinks-republican-house-majority" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>REP.
