<p>Democrat-turned-Republican Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson is offering a sanctuary from socialism, charting a starkly different course from New York City as he argues progressive policies there are driving businesses away and weakening public safety.</p><p>"It appears to be that New York wants to be the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/socialism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heartbeat of socialism</a> in the United States. That appears to be the direction it's going," he said Sunday.</p><p>"But down here in Dallas, I can tell you, we embrace business, we embrace capitalism, we embrace corporations who employ folks and who are actually pillars of our communities."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-hampshire-governor-recruits-nyc-business-owners-fleeing-mamdani-regime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR RECRUITS NYC BUSINESS OWNERS FLEEING MAMDANI 'REGIME'</strong></a></p><p>Johnson declared that "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s cities need Republicans</a>" and pledged to adhere to fiscal conservatism and law-and-order principles when he announced his party switch in a 2023 Wall Street Journal op-ed.</p><p>Speaking with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade Sunday, Johnson said Dallas was already emerging as a financial services hub before the election of New York City’s new mayor, a trend he said is now accelerating.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mayor-dallas-switch-gop-last-year-should-have-been-wake-up-call-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>OPINION: I'M THE MAYOR OF DALLAS. MY SWITCH TO THE GOP LAST YEAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WAKE-UP CALL FOR DEMOCRATS</u></strong></a></p><p>"I'm already getting phone calls. We're already having more conversations than we've ever had before, more interest in moving to Dallas by New York-based financial firms," he said.</p><p>"The answer is there is a flood and an avalanche of interest in being where I think people who do this for a living, folks in the financial services industry, understand that the future of capitalism in this country is moving west," he added.</p><p>Johnson said Dallas’ refusal to adopt sanctuary city policies has helped position the city as a destination for businesses and workers seeking stability, safety and a pro-growth environment.</p><p>"We support law enforcement here in Dallas. We support law and order. I don’t think you can have a city if you don’t have safety," Johnson said.</p><p>"I don’t understand the impulse some of these <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrat mayors</a> have to embrace lawlessness."</p>
