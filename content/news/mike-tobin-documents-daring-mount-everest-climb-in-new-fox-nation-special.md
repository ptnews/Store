Don't make any mistakes. Don't turn what's otherwise going to be a celebration into a tragedy.'"</p><p>About 700 to 1,000 climbers attempt the summit each year, with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/extreme-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>success rates</u></a> ranging between 60% and 70%, according to Climbing Kilimanjaro. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/fox-news-mike-tobin-completes-risky-everest-climb-details-high-stakes-summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOX NEWS’ MIKE TOBIN COMPLETES RISKY EVEREST CLIMB AND SHARES DETAILS OF HIGH-STAKES SUMMIT</strong></a></p><p>It takes a special type of person to risk life and limb for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/10-best-mountain-views" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the chance to look down</a> from the world's highest mountaintop.
