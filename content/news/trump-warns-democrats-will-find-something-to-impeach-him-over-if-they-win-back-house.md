<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> warned Tuesday that Democrats would "find something" to impeach him over if they take back the House in November.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They'll find something</a>. There'll be something," he said during an exclusive interview on "The Will Cain Show." </p><p>"I made the wrong turn at an exit, and let's impeach him. They did that before. They impeached me on a perfect phone call, turned out. They impeached me twice and, by the way, I won the impeachments very easily and quickly, but they impeach. They're very nasty people [and] they have bad policy."</p><p>The president joined the show live from Iowa, where he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-launches-midterm-push-iowa-warns-losses-would-derail-agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off a push</a> toward the 2026 midterm elections through interactions with voters that culminated in a campaign-style event in Clive.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/here-key-2026-house-senate-races-watch-could-decide-control-congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HERE ARE THE KEY 2026 HOUSE AND SENATE RACES TO WATCH THAT COULD DECIDE CONTROL OF CONGRESS</strong></a></p><p>History indicates Trump – and Republicans as a whole – face an uphill battle as the majority party heading into November. </p><p>Since the 1930s, midterm elections have almost always resulted in the president’s party losing House seats, and often control of the House.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hits-road-sell-economic-wins-republicans-brace-high-stakes-midterm-showdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP HITS THE ROAD TO SELL ECONOMIC WINS, AS REPUBLICANS BRACE FOR HIGH-STAKES MIDTERM SHOWDOWN</u></strong></a></p><p>Trump acknowledged that reality while speaking to Cain.</p><p>"Whether it's Republican or Democrat, when they win, it doesn't make any difference. They seem to lose the midterms, so that's the only thing I worry about," he said.</p><p>"Maybe they [voters] want to put up a guard fence. You just don't know. It doesn't make sense. Even if a president did well, they seemed to lose the midterms, but hopefully we're going to change that around."</p><p>Republicans currently have a razor-thin majority in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House of Representatives</a>, holding 218 seats to the Democrats' 213.</p>
