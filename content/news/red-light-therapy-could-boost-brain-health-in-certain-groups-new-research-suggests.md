<p>Red light therapy has been shown to reduce brain inflammation, protecting people who experience <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/head-injury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head trauma</a> from long-term health consequences, a University of Utah study has shown.</p><p>Brain damage from repeated impact over the years is known to cause cognitive symptoms, ranging from memory issues to full-blown dementia, particularly affecting soldiers and athletes.</p><p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive, degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head impacts rather than a single injury, according to Mayo Clinic.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/alzheimers-scientists-find-key-halting-brain-decline-before-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ALZHEIMER’S SCIENTISTS FIND KEY TO HALTING BRAIN DECLINE BEFORE SYMPTOMS</strong></a></p><p>More than 100 former NFL <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/orthopedics/sports-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">football players</a> have been posthumously diagnosed with CTE, according to the new study, which was published in the Journal of Neurotrauma.</p><p>Other research has shown that military personnel in active combat suffer from similar issues, as do first responders <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/veterans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and veterans</a>.</p><p>In the new study, the researchers recruited 26 current football players to understand more about the impact of red-light therapy on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain injuries</a>.</p><p>The participants received either red light therapy delivered by a light-emitting headset and a device that clips into the nose, or a placebo treatment with an identical device that doesn’t produce light.
