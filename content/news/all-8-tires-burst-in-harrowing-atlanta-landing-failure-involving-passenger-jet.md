<p>First responders in Atlanta rushed to an airport runway Tuesday after an aircraft experienced a harrowing landing failure, with all eight of its landing tires bursting the moment the plane touched down, according to <a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/expert-brake-issue-likely-caused-all-8-tires-melt-latam-jet-atlanta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 5 Atlanta</a>.</p><p>LATAM Flight 2482, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boeing 767</a>, landed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Tuesday evening after a seven-hour flight from Lima, Peru.</p><p>According to Fox 5, citing a flight expert, the unusual incident may not have been the result of a hard landing, but a possible malfunction in the aircraft’s automatic braking system.</p><p>Images from the aftermath revealed dislodged cabin panels and a bathroom door torn from its hinges, according to the local station.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/cause-failed-alaska-airlines-landing-gear-sent-passengers-screaming-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CAUSE OF FAILED ALASKA AIRLINES LANDING GEAR THAT SENT PASSENGERS SCREAMING REVEALED</strong></a></p><p>No injuries were reported after the incident, but <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">airport staff</a> who witnessed the landing described hearing multiple popping sounds as the wheels hit the tarmac followed by visible smoke.</p><p>"I was at work and my coworkers and I heard a couple of loud bangs and saw a lot of smoke," a user posted on social media Tuesday. "One of the airport ops guys told us that the plane landed so hard that all the tires blew out."</p><p>Another traveler noted that, as the plane decelerated, another passenger recalled the unsettling sensation of wheels "rattling on the tarmac" for an unusually long time, Fox 5 reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/jetblue-aircraft-rolls-off-runway-while-landing-bostons-logan-airport" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JETBLUE AIRCRAFT ROLLS OFF RUNWAY WHILE LANDING AT BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORT</strong></a></p><p>The 221 people on board were reportedly stranded on the tarmac for two hours before being transported to the terminal by bus.</p><p>Speaking to Fox 5, retired Capt. Paul Carr, who flew 767s for years, called the incident "very odd." The former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta pilot</a> said that while tire blowouts are relatively common, it is rare for all eight tires to fail at once. He added that a malfunction in the automatic braking system likely triggered the disaster by locking the wheels and generating extreme friction.</p><p> "That's very odd for all eight tires to blow on a landing," Carr said. "More than likely, the brake system logic ... malfunctioned, and it locked up all the brakes and just caused them to blow."</p><p>The incident prompted a temporary runway shutdown but did not significantly alter overall airport operations.</p><p>Fox News reached out to LATAM and the Federal Aviation Administration for more information.</p>
