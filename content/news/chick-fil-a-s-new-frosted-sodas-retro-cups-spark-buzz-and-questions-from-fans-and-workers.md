<p>Chick-fil-A unveiled brand-new drinks and "retro-inspired" merchandise on Monday, sparking buzz — and debate — among fans and employees.</p><p>In a Jan. 5 news release, the Atlanta-based chain announced it would begin offering <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/soft-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frosted sodas and floats</a> on its permanent menu.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The drinks</a> are "hand-spun with Icedream [Chick-fil-A's vanilla soft serve] and guests' choice of fountain beverage for a smooth, creamy treat with a retro twist," the company said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/taco-bell-tops-new-drive-thru-speed-rankings-chick-fil-a-wins-satisfaction"><strong><u>TACO BELL TOPS NEW DRIVE-THRU SPEED RANKINGS, AND CHICK-FIL-A WINS ON SATISFACTION</u></strong></a></p><p>The brand is offering three core flavors: Coca-Cola, Dr. Pepper and Sprite, with additional options including Fanta, Powerade, Hi-C and Barq's Root Beer.</p><p>In addition to the frosted drinks, Chick-fil-A is also inviting fans to participate in its Golden Fan Cup sweepstakes.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast-food chain</a> is selling four "retro-inspired" cup designs inspired by past Chick-fil-A looks. Customers can buy the cups for $3.99.</p><p>A total of 3,000 Gold Fan Cups are available — and if a customer purchases a classic cup and receives a Gold Fan Cup, the person can receive free Chick-fil-A food for a year.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>The celebrations are "nods to Chick-fil-A's 80-year heritage," said the press release. </p><p>"This year marks more than an anniversary — it's a celebration of the memories, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meals and meaningful moments</a> that have brought people together at Chick-fil-A for generations," Khalilah Cooper, vice president of brand strategy, advertising and media at Chick-fil-A, said in a statement. </p><p>In a post on a Reddit forum dedicated to Chick-fil-A, users shared reactions to the frosted sodas ahead of the rollout.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Frosted Dr. Pepper sounds fantastic," one person wrote.</p><p>"The Hi-C one sounds promising," another chimed in.</p><p>"These were tested in [Southern California] and they were pretty good. Not too expensive from what I recall too," a third user said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>Still, despite the buzz, one customer was unmoved by the new packaging.</p><p>"I don't care [about] the packaging. Just give us lower prices," the Redditor wrote.</p><p>Another Redditor added, "It's not that bad. But when you can spend the same amount going to a fast-casual restaurant and get much <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better food,</a> then the choice is obvious."</p><p>Likewise, some people claiming to be Chick-fil-A workers expressed reservations.</p><p>"Yay, now we can make drinks <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/dessert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and desserts</a> even more complicated!" an employee said.</p><p>"These are so messy to make," another wrote.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Chick-fil-A for additional comment.</p>
