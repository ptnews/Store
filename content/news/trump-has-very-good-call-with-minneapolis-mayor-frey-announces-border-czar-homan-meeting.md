"The president agreed the present situation can’t continue.</p><p>"Some federal agents will begin leaving the area tomorrow, and I will continue pushing for the rest involved in this operation to go," he continued. "Minneapolis will continue to cooperate with state and federal law enforcement on real criminal investigations — but we will not participate in unconstitutional arrests of our neighbors or enforce federal immigration law."</p><p>Frey said violent criminals should be held accountable for the crimes they commit, not based on where they are from.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-says-violent-mob-helped-criminal-escape-left-ice-agent-permanently-maimed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE SAYS VIOLENT MOB HELPED CRIMINAL ESCAPE AND LEFT ICE AGENT PERMANENTLY MAIMED</strong></a></p><p>"I will continue working with all levels of government to keep our communities safe, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep crime down</a>, and put Minneapolis residents first," he wrote, confirming he also plans to meet with Homan on Tuesday to discuss next steps.</p><p>The social media posts came hours after Trump spoke with Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> about the unrest gripping Minneapolis in the wake of federal immigration enforcement actions.</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the call during her Monday briefing, saying Trump wants to "let cops be cops" as authorities respond to the unrest.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-deploys-border-czar-tom-homan-minnesota-ice-operations-face-violent-chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP DEPLOYS BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN TO MINNESOTA AS ICE OPERATIONS FACE VIOLENT CHAOS</strong></a></p><p>She criticized <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walz and Frey</a> for what she described as encouraging anti-ICE agitators, which she argued contributed to the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, who were killed by law enforcement this month.</p><p>Leavitt said Trump wants the unrest to end immediately and outlined what she called a clear path to restoring law and order in Minnesota, beginning with a demand that state and local officials turn over illegal aliens who are incarcerated or have active warrants or known criminal histories.</p><p>Trump is also calling on local law enforcement to assist federal authorities by transferring custody of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested illegal aliens</a> and helping locate suspects wanted for crimes.</p><p>"We want to let cops be cops," Leavitt said.</p>
