They recently competed together on Season 4 of the hit Fox show "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/special-forces-stars-jessie-james-decker-husband-eric-share-key-successful-12-year-marriage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Special Forces: World's Toughest Test</a>."</p><p>The two performed well on the show. However, Eric was medically withdrawn from the competition on the sixth day due to a back injury from one of the challenges. After learning her husband would be leaving, Jessie withdrew from the competition, choosing to leave with Eric.</p><p><strong>WATCH: Jessie James Decker is a 'very proud military brat'</strong></p><p>Eric and Jessie have family members who served in the military, and Jessie told Fox News Digital in October 2025 she "wanted to make my family proud" while on the show, adding, "I'm a very proud military brat."</p><p>Being on the show was also frustrating for Jessie, who realized the typical U.S. citizen doesn't realize or appreciate "how good" they have it at home.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

"I think that, as we were there, and I saw how people are living in Morocco [where 'Special Forces' films] and seeing how hard it is just day in day out what our military goes through, it almost stirred up an anger of, 'Like, I can't believe anyone would ever complain back home.'</p><p>"We have it so damn good, you know. It definitely lit a fire in me. I <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jessie-james-deckers-warrior-bloodline-makes-her-proud-military-brat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will never complain again</a>," she added. "Just because we have it so good. And look at, look at how these men and women are fighting for us and the living conditions and what they're going through just to keep our country safe. It just, yeah, it fired me up."</p>
