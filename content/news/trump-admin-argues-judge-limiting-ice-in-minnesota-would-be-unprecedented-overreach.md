<p>The Trump administration on Monday asked a federal judge to reject the state of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota’s</a> motion to limit ICE operations in the state, arguing to do so would be "unprecedented" overreach.</p><p>The Justice Department (DOJ) argued in a filing in response to Minnesota’s lawsuit that the state was "effectively seeking a state veto over the enforcement of federal law," calling the notion "legally frivolous" and an "absurdity."</p><p>"The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/states-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10th Amendment</a> does not afford an ejectment action for states who are dissatisfied with the federal government’s enforcement of federal law," the DOJ response said.</p><p>The state sued the Trump administration last week, seeking to block a massive federal immigration enforcement surge they say has flooded the Twin Cities with armed agents, sparked fear and unrest, and interfered with state and local authorities, according to court filings.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-says-2-demonstrators-were-arrested-minnesota-allegedly-assaulting-officers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE SAYS 2 DEMONSTRATORS WERE ARRESTED IN MINNESOTA FOR ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING OFFICERS</strong></a></p><p>An injunction blocking the operation "would constitute an unprecedented act of judicial overreach," the administration’s filing said. The DOJ further argued that federal officers and agents were facing a rise in "violent attacks" while conducting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enforcement operations</a>."</p><p>"In and around Minneapolis, ICE officers operating out of the St. Paul Office have been confronted with increased threats, violence, aggression, attacks, vehicle block-ins, and obstruction of immigration enforcement operations," the filing said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minnesota-ag-keith-ellison-denies-don-lemon-anti-ice-protesters-violated-face-act-doj-mulls-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA AG KEITH ELLISON DENIES DON LEMON, ANTI-ICE PROTESTERS VIOLATED FACE ACT AS DOJ MULLS CHARGES</strong></a></p><p>The state has until Thursday to respond to the Trump administration’s arguments.</p><p>The state’s lawsuit comes nearly a week after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-video-shows-minutes-leading-up-deadly-minneapolis-ice-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">an ICE agent shot and killed</a> a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman during a federal enforcement operation in south Minneapolis.

The Trump administration and Minnesota officials have traded blame for the heightened tensions.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Greg Wehner and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
