<p>Prominent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catholic Bishop Robert Barron</a> is speaking out against a mob of agitators who stormed a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday to protest ICE.</p><p>Barron, who leads the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, just southeast of St. Paul, and is the founder of "Word on Fire" Ministries, called the disruption "unacceptable."</p><p>"I don’t care what is animating or annoying you, I don’t care what your political persuasion might be, invading a church is unacceptable and is a violation of religious liberty," Barron wrote in an X post on Monday.</p><p>This comes after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-ice-mob-storms-minnesota-church-over-pastors-alleged-ties-immigration-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of anti-ICE agitators</a> disrupted a service at Cities Church, a Baptist congregation, chanting "Justice for Renee Good" and "Who needs justice, we need justice," as they stood <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">inside the church</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-accuses-tim-walz-ilhan-omar-using-ice-protests-distract-massive-state-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ACCUSES TIM WALZ AND ILHAN OMAR OF USING ICE PROTESTS TO DISTRACT FROM MASSIVE STATE FRAUD</strong></a></p><p>Barron addressed the widespread anti-ICE unrest in Minnesota in a separate X post on Sunday.

The Trump Administration and ICE should limit themselves, at least for the time being, to rounding up undocumented people who have committed serious crimes. Political leaders should stop stirring up resentment against officers who are endeavoring to enforce the laws of the country. And protestors should cease interfering with the work of ICE," he suggested.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-donalds-accuses-minnesota-democrats-stoking-anti-ice-unrest-after-agitators-storm-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>REP DONALDS ACCUSES MINNESOTA DEMOCRATS OF STOKING ANTI-ICE UNREST AFTER AGITATORS STORM CHURCH</strong></a></p><p>"And everyone on all sides must stop shouting at one another and demonizing their opponents.
