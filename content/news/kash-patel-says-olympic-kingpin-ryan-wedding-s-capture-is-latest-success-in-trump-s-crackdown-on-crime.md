"He's a modern-day El Chapo. He is a modern-day Pablo Escobar, and he thought he could evade justice."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wanted-olympian-turned-fugitive-ryan-wedding-custody-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>WANTED EX-OLYMPIAN RYAN WEDDING CAPTURED IN MEXICO, FBI DIRECTOR KASH PATEL FLIES HIM BACK TO US</u></strong></a></p><p>"This individual and his organization and the Sinaloa Cartel poured narcotics into the streets of North America and killed too many of our youth and corrupted too many of our citizens. And that ends today." </p><p>Patel called 2025 a "historic year" for the FBI, noting that the bureau has made 67,000 arrests this year alone – a 200% increase from previous years. </p><p>"The FBI has captured six of the Top Ten Most [Wanted] fugitives on our board. The FBI has also seized enough fentanyl to kill 150 million Americans, a 31% increase. The FBI has arrested 35% more espionage corrupt actors from China, Russia, the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and Iran. The FBI has found and identified 6,000 children that were missing. That is up 22%.  All of these historic record breaking numbers lead to another historic record-breaking number brought to you by President Trump's leadership. That is a 20% decline in the murder rate in the United States of America."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p> FBI Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis said 36 individuals have already been arrested in connection with Wedding’s alleged crime ring.
