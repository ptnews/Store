<p>Minneapolis agitators vandalized and spray-painted a threatening anti-U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) message onto a vehicle believed to be used by federal officers during unrest on Wednesday, video footage from the scene shows. </p><p>The incident came after the Department of Homeland Security said an ICE agent shot an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">illegal immigrant from Venezuela</a> in the leg after an alleged shovel attack during an ambush.</p><p>The video shows a vandal spraying "Only good agent is a dead one" in red paint across the side of the vehicle. It does not appear anyone was inside the vehicle at the time. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-demands-mn-leaders-honor-ice-detainers-alleges-hundreds-criminal-aliens-have-been-released-under-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DHS DEMANDS MN LEADERS HONOR ICE DETAINERS, ALLEGES HUNDREDS OF CRIMINAL ALIENS HAVE BEEN RELEASED UNDER WALZ</strong></a></p><p>A separate "f--- ICE" message was also spray-painted on the vehicle. Its driver’s window appeared <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smashed</a>, with the vehicle’s exterior showing signs of heavy damage, including torn panels and loose materials hanging from the body.</p><p>"This is what you get when you come to Minneapolis," one man can be heard saying as the vandal defaces the vehicle. At least two other vehicles were damaged. </p><p>Scores of demonstrators gathered at the scene, shouting expletives at federal agents and demanding they leave the city, the <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/14/second-person-in-a-week-shot-by-federal-immigration-agent-in-minneapolis/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Minnesota Reformer</a> reported. As tensions escalated, federal agents deployed tear gas and flash bangs to disperse the crowd, while some protesters shot fireworks and other projectiles toward law enforcement during the chaos.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-agent-struck-renee-goods-vehicle-suffered-internal-bleeding-torso-dhs-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE AGENT STRUCK BY RENEE GOOD'S VEHICLE SUFFERED INTERNAL BLEEDING TO TORSO, DHS SAYS</strong></a></p><p>According to the outlet, at least two people were detained after fireworks were thrown. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the crowd crossed the line into an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlawful assembly</a>, prompting assistance from the Minnesota State Patrol and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. Mayor Jacob Frey renewed his call for residents to remain peaceful and not "take the bait."</p><p>During the earlier shooting incident, DHS said the agent fired after fearing for his life during a physical struggle in which the suspect, an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal alien from Venezuela</a>, resisted arrest and assaulted the officer.</p><p>DHS said federal officers were conducting a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis around 6:50 p.m. when the suspect fled in his vehicle, crashed into a parked car and ran on foot. An officer caught up to the suspect, who continued to resist arrest and assault the officer, according to DHS.</p><p>During the struggle, two additional individuals allegedly joined in, attacking the officer with a snow shovel and broom handle. DHS said the agent, fearing for his life while being attacked by three people, fired a defensive shot, striking the suspect in the leg.</p><p>All three individuals fled into an apartment and barricaded themselves before being taken into custody. The officer and the suspect were transported to the hospital, DHS said.</p><p>Authorities said the man’s injuries were not life-threatening.</p><p>Anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis have escalated in recent days following the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/omar-dems-demand-noem-impeachment-paint-minnesota-woman-shot-ice-poet-chose-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good</a> last week during a federal immigration enforcement operation.</p>
