The right scent can instantly change the mood, whether you prefer <a href="https://amzn.to/4jMVJ0x" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">warm vanilla</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/4jLMzRE" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">smoky sandalwood</a> or <a href="https://fave.co/4r3eyii" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">crisp citrus</a>. We rounded up the best candles to buy right now, including top-rated soy, beeswax and paraffin picks that you'll want to light all winter long. Our list includes trusted brands like <a href="https://amzn.to/3YOn7S8" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Yankee Candle</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/49GAb0J" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Nest</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/4r8TwyV" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Voluspa</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/4qUJBg0" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">P.F.

What's most impressive, though, is the scent throw and durability. It fills the room and stays strong from the first light to the final flicker — a feature that's not commonly seen in candles at this price point.</p><p><strong>READ MORE: </strong><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/deals/seasonal-decor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>11 simple upgrades to get your home winter-ready — shop throws, rugs, diffusers and more</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://fave.co/49GAb0J" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Nest New York candles</a> are the kind you get as a gift once — and then keep buying for yourself. The Wild Mint &amp; Eucalyptus scent from the brand's Wellness line is crisp and fresh, with layers of mint, basil, eucalyptus and Thai ginger.

With up to 60 hours of burn time, it produces a rich, complex fragrance that smells like a luxury candle you'll find in a five-star hotel bathroom.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/4b58l0F" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">This set</a> includes four beautifully packaged candles, each with a fresh, inviting scent.

Each candle burns for 25 to 30 hours and comes in a decorative tin that’s gift-ready, straight out of the box.</p><p><strong>Original price: $24.99</strong></p><p>If you like woodsy scents that aren’t too overpowering, <a href="https://amzn.to/4jLMzRE" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Yankee Candle’s Amber &amp; Sandalwood</a> strikes the perfect balance.

It burns evenly and slowly for up to 120 hours.</p><p>Wind down with this <a href="https://amzn.to/464Bqps" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">La Jolie Muse Santal Rose</a> candle. The daisy-embossed jar feels delicate and dainty but still incredibly detailed, and the Santal Rose scent — which blends lush rose blossoms with a warm sandalwood base — is soft and subtle. Made with soy wax and a cotton wick, this clean-burning candle lasts up to 40 hours, and the vessel is so stunning that you'll want to leave it out, even when the wax is fully melted.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/49KpjPl" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">P.F. Candle Co.’s Golden Coast candle</a> is designed to smell like California in a jar — earthy, fresh and a little wild. It opens with eucalyptus, sea salt and lime, then layers in white lavender, sage, redwood, fir and palo santo for a scent that’s bold but never overpowering. The 7.2-ounce soy candle is hand-poured in the USA and burns for 40 to 50 hours. Housed in an amber glass jar with a vintage-style kraft label, it has that cool apothecary look at a price that won't break the bank.</p><p><a href="https://fave.co/4r3eyii" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">Jo Malone’s Orange Blossom candle</a> is a splurge — but its extensive and smooth burn, top-of-the-line vessel quality and unique fragrance justifies its cost. The scent is fresh and floral with just the right touch of sweetness, blending orange blossom and clementine flower with warm, woodsy vetiver and orris. It’s light, elegant and lingers beautifully long after it's been extinguished. Housed in Jo Malone’s signature glass jar, it’s as refined on your shelf as it is in the air.</p><p><strong>For more deals, visit </strong><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/deals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>www.foxnews.com/deals</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>A gourmand scent is one that smells good enough to eat — think dessert-inspired notes like vanilla, caramel, chocolate, cinnamon or even buttered popcorn. These candles often feel warm, inviting and sweet, like you just walked into a bakery.</p><p>Soy, paraffin and beeswax are different types of candle wax, and they each have different origins. Soy and beeswax candles are usually cleaner burning (meaning they produce less soot), while paraffin tends to have a stronger scent. If you're picky about what goes in the air, go for soy or natural blends.</p><p>There are more candle wick types than you might expect. Cotton wicks are the most common, known for their steady, clean burn. Wooden wicks burn more slowly and create a fireplace-like crackle, while hemp wicks — often used in all-natural candles — deliver a consistent flame. No matter the style, trimming your wick before each burn helps your candle last longer and burn cleaner. Scissors work, but a <a href="https://amzn.to/4pNfLZU" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">wick trimmer</a> does it best.</p><p><strong>If you’re an </strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4qxuIAI" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener"><strong>Amazon Prime member</strong></a><strong>, you can get these items sent to your door ASAP.
