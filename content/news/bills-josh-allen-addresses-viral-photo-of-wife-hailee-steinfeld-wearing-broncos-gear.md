CBS sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson asked Allen about the viral picture.</p><p>"Asked Josh about this pic and he told me he had no idea it was floating around. Laughed and said she was probably paid to be there. And that he definitely wasn’t going to bring it up at home," Wolfson posted <a href="https://x.com/tracywolfson/status/2011918015915339886?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">on X.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Allen and Steinfeld got married in June 2025 and announced they were expecting their first child together in December 2025.</p><p>Last week was eventful for the couple.
