<p>Only one more week of the 2025 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL</a> regular season remains, as Week 17 brought about some more playoff implications and even 2026 NFL Draft key positions.</p><p>The biggest takeaway from the slate of Week 17 is that two divisions in the NFL — the AFC North and NFC South — will be determined by whoever wins key matchups in Week 18.</p><p>First, it’s the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> getting upset by the Cleveland Browns at home, as Aaron Rodgers couldn’t find Marquez Valdes-Scantling on a controversial game-ending play in the end zone. That loss sets up the AFC North title game between the Steelers and Baltimore Ravens, which is only possibly thanks to a road victory where Derrick Henry scored four touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers.</p><p>Then, despite both the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tampa-bay-buccaneers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> and Carolina Panthers losing their respective matchups, the NFL tiebreakers make their Week 18 bout the NFC South title game.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>And while everyone was focused on the NFL playoff picture, the two-game 4 o’clock slate gave us the New York Giants against the Las Vegas Raiders, the winner of which owning the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft.</p><p>The Giants would’ve solidified the pick with a loss, but Jaxson Dart and the Giants’ offense blew out Geno Smith and the Raiders to relinquish the pick, which now belongs in Sin City.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-week-16-scores-playoff-pressure-leads-thrilling-finishes-across-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NFL WEEK 16 SCORES: PLAYOFF PRESSURE LEADS TO THRILLING FINISHES ACROSS LEAGUE</strong></a></p><p>Here's how every NFL game played out:</p><p><strong>- DALLAS COWBOYS 30, WASHINGTON COMMANDERS 23</strong></p><p><strong>- MINNESOTA VIKINGS 23, DETROIT LIONS 10</strong></p><p><strong>- DENVER BRONCOS 20, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 13</strong></p><p><strong>- HOUSTON TEXANS 20, LOS ANGELES CHARGERS 16</strong></p><p><strong>- BALTIMORE RAVENS 41, GREEN BAY PACKERS 24</strong></p><p><strong>- CINCINNATI BENGALS 37, ARIZONA CARDINALS 14</strong></p><p><strong>- CLEVELAND BROWNS 13, PITTSBURGH STEELERS 7</strong></p><p><strong>- NEW ORLEANS SAINTS 34, TENNESSEE TITANS 26</strong></p><p><strong>- JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS 23, INDIANAPOLIS COLTS 17</strong></p><p><strong>- MIAMI DOLPHINS 20, TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS 17</strong></p><p><strong>- NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS 42, NEW YORK JETS 10</strong></p><p><strong>- SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 27, CAROLINA PANTHERS 10</strong></p><p><strong>- NEW YORK GIANTS 34, LAS VEGAS RAIDERS 10</strong></p><p><strong>- PHILADELPHIA EAGLES 13, BUFFALO BILLS 12</strong></p><p><strong>- SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS-CHICAGO BEARS (TBD)</strong></p><p><strong>- LOS ANGELES RAMS-ATLANTA FALCONS (TBD)</strong></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
