<p>After the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami Dolphins</a> fired head coach Mike McDaniel on Thursday, a quarter of the NFL now has head coaching vacancies.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Giants</a> and Tennessee Titans fired their head coaches midseason, giving them a leg up on starting a search while the rest of the NFL waited until after Week 18 to make a decision.</p><p>The Titans fired Brian Callahan in Week 7 after a 1-5 start and promoted senior offensive assistant Mike McCoy to serve as the team’s interim head coach. McCoy is unlikely to be hired as the full-time coach, as the team went 2-9 under him.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Callahan was in his second season when he was fired and had a 4-19 record as the Titans’ head coach.</p><p>The Giants fired Brian Daboll after blowing a 10-point fourth-quarter lead to the Chicago Bears, a game in which rookie quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jaxson-dart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaxson Dart</a> sustained a concussion, which dropped them to 2-8. Offensive coordinator Mike Kafka was named interim coach and went 2-5 in his seven games.</p><p>Daboll was in his fourth season and amassed a 20-40-1 record. He was named NFL Coach of the Year in his first season after leading the Giants to a 9-7-1 record and a playoff berth, but the team’s record worsened in every season.</p><p>While Kafka won his last two games and received an interview for the full-time position, he is unlikely to receive the Giants’ head coaching job.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/shedeur-sanders-already-looking-forward-after-browns-fire-head-coach-kevin-stefanski-just-how-league-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SHEDEUR SANDERS ALREADY LOOKING FORWARD AFTER BROWNS FIRE HEAD COACH KEVIN STEFANSKI: 'JUST HOW THE LEAGUE IS'</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/atlanta-falcons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta Falcons</a> became the third team to have a vacancy and wasted little time, firing head coach Raheem Morris on Sunday. The team fired Morris after back-to-back 8-9 seasons.</p><p>The Falcons had won their last four games, leading some to believe Morris might be afforded a third season, but owner Arthur Blank had other plans. The Giants, Arizona Cardinals <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tennessee-titans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Titans</a> have all scheduled interviews with Morris, according to multiple reports.</p><p>The Falcons also fired general manager Terry Fontenot after five seasons on Sunday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jim-harbaugh-predicts-brothers-future-nfl-next-season-just-hope-its-nfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JIM HARBAUGH PREDICTS BROTHER'S FUTURE IN NFL NEXT SEASON: 'JUST HOPE IT'S THE NFC'</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cleveland-browns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleveland Browns</a> were the first team to make a move on "Black Monday," as they fired two-time NFL Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski. The Browns went 5-12 in Stefanski’s final season.</p><p>In six seasons with the Browns, Stefanski went 45-56 with two playoff berths and one postseason win. The Giants have reportedly already interviewed Stefanksi, while the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/las-vegas-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas Raiders</a> and Titans have interviews scheduled, according to multiple reports.</p><p>The Raiders were the next team to make a move, dismissing Pete Carroll after one disastrous season. The Raiders were 3-14 but were rewarded for their dismal season with the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dolphins-turning-hall-fame-quarterback-help-find-next-general-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOLPHINS TURNING TO HALL OF FAME QUARTERBACK TO HELP FIND NEXT GENERAL MANAGER: REPORT</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/arizona-cardinals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cardinals</a> were the last team to fire their coach on "Black Monday," firing head coach Jonathan Gannon after three seasons. The Cardinals were 3-14 this season, losing their final nine games.</p><p>It looked like the Cardinals were building something when they went 8-9 in 2024, but the team regressed.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/baltimore-ravens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltimore Ravens</a> shocked the world when they parted ways with John Harbaugh after 18 seasons on Tuesday. Harbaugh was the second-longest-tenured coach in the NFL, behind only the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Mike Tomlin.</p><p>The Ravens underperformed this season, going 8-9 and missing the playoffs in heartbreaking fashion on Sunday, and the team moved on just a couple of days later. Harbaugh immediately became the top head coaching candidate on the market and has drawn interest from all teams with a vacancy, according to multiple reports.</p><p>Harbaugh went 180-113 in his Ravens’ tenure, which included a Super Bowl win in 2012 over his brother, Jim Harbaugh.</p><p>The Dolphins were the latest team to make a move, firing McDaniel on Thursday and creating the eighth head coaching vacancy. McDaniel went 35-33 in four seasons with the Dolphins, including two trips to the playoffs.</p><p>McDaniel is widely regarded as one of the best offensive minds in the NFL and is reportedly expected to draw interest.</p><p>This offseason is the second consecutive offseason where there are eight openings, with the Raiders the lone team participating in a head coaching search in both offseasons.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
