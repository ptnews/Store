<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/oregon-ducks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dante Moore</a> is not going anywhere.</p><p>The Oregon quarterback announced Wednesday that, despite being in line to be taken No. 2 overall by the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-jets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Jets</a> later this year, he will stay in school for one more year.</p><p>Moore said he will stay put in Oregon despite star quarterback Dylan Raiola transferring there.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>"I'll be coming back to Oregon one more year," Moore told ESPN.</p><p>Moore shot up the quarterback prospect list in his first full season with Oregon. He completed 71.2 percent of his passes for 3,565 yards, 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. </p><p>He started at UCLA and saw time in nine games, starting several, but he transferred to Oregon before the 2024 season and backed up Dillon Gabriel that year.</p><p>Moore took over this past season and impressed, bringing the Ducks all the way to the College Football Playoff semifinal last week, but they were walloped by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/indiana-hoosiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No. 1 Indiana,</a> 56-22.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-jets-gm-says-fans-should-trust-long-term-plan-aaron-glenn-despite-top-coaches-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FORMER JETS GM SAYS FANS SHOULD TRUST 'LONG-TERM PLAN' WITH AARON GLENN DESPITE TOP COACHES AVAILABLE</strong></a></p><p>Moore figured to be the second pick behind Fernando Mendoza, who won the Heisman Trophy and will play for a national championship and 16-0 season next week against No. 10 Miami. The Jets own the second pick and are certainly in quarterback limbo after starting Justin Fields, Tyrod Taylor and Brady Cook this season.</p><p>Trinidad Chambliss and Ty Simpson figure to be available for the Jets, who also own the 16th and 33rd picks in the draft.</p><p>The Jets aren't the only ones affected, though. Considering Raiola, a former five-star recruit, just transferred, it figures the newcomer may be backing up Moore in 2026.</p><p>Assuming Moore starts in 2026, it will be the first time since before Bo Nix that Dan Lanning will have the same starting quarterback in back-to-back seasons.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
