<p>With new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/health-experts-react-andrew-huberman-backs-trump-admins-new-food-pyramid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dietary guidelines</a> circulating this week from Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — including advice to "limit alcoholic beverages" — some wine lovers may have a key question: Is red wine or white wine healthier?</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/drinks/wine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red and white wines</a> are both typically made from grapes. Red wine gets its color from grape juice fermenting with grape skins, while white wine does not.</p><p>Because some white wines are sweeter, many people assume they're packed with more calories.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/red-wine-good-heart-consider-wisdom-cardiac-surgeon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IS RED WINE GOOD FOR YOUR HEART? CONSIDER THIS WISDOM FROM A CARDIAC SURGEON</strong></a></p><p>Others are drawn to red wine for its association with the Mediterranean diet, a pattern of eating linked with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart health</a> in some studies — though it's not clear whether the wine itself is the driver of those benefits.</p><p>There are actually "fewer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health differences</a> between red and white wine than many people think," said Dr. Stacie Stephenson, a physician based in Illinois. </p><p>"White wine has slightly more sugar, slightly fewer calories [due to lower alcohol content] and fewer antioxidants," she told Fox News Digital. "The differences are negligible."</p><p>Stephenson also disputed the myth that red wine is significantly healthier than white.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"Red wine has more antioxidants because it is made using the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skins of grapes</a>, which are especially rich in an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant polyphenol called resveratrol," she said. </p><p>"Otherwise, there is little difference."</p><p>Some research has suggested resveratrol and other polyphenols might influence certain markers like LDL cholesterol or blood vessel function — but these effects are typically observed in lab studies or at high doses not achievable through normal wine consumption, according to a Brown University study.</p><p>No amount <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of alcohol</a> is truly "healthy," Stephenson stressed. She cited recent studies that link it with a higher risk of cancer.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breast cancer</a>, in particular, is related to alcohol consumption, but so are liver, colorectal, throat, esophageal and stomach cancers," she said. </p><p>"Anyone with a history or family history of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breast or digestive system cancers</a> should not drink alcohol."</p><p>Though white wine has fewer calories, Stephenson noted that red wine's antioxidant properties may offer some biological effects — while emphasizing risk.</p><p>"The less you drink of any alcohol, the better. None is best," she said. </p><p>"However, I know many people are never going to give up drinking wine — so if you want to make the best choice, choose red wine for the antioxidant benefits."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>The doctor suggested getting resveratrol by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating berries</a>, peanuts or red grapes if you opt for white wine.</p><p>Stephenson added that the number of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/non-alcoholic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-alcoholic wine</a> companies is growing — and they're improving their products — for drinkers who want to cut back on alcohol intake. </p><p>"These red wines offer the resveratrol benefits without the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer risks</a> of alcohol," she said. </p><p>"These also provide the wine experience without the downsides."</p><p>"Some people won't be interested in these," added Stephenson. "But they are steadily gaining in popularity."</p>
