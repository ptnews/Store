As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district.

"So, criminal, illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice under his administration."</p>
