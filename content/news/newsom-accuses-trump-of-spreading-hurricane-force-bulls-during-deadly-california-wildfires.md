In the Palisades, there was a shortage of water at some point, or is that not accurate?" Musk asked the fire command team.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/colorado-governor-accuses-trump-playing-political-games-after-fema-denies-disaster-requests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COLORADO GOVERNOR ACCUSES TRUMP OF PLAYING 'POLITICAL GAMES' AFTER FEMA DENIES DISASTER REQUESTS</strong></a></p><p>"We were flowing an amount of water that the system couldn't [handle] … it was overbearing just because of how much water these firefighters were utilizing," an official replied.</p><p>Musk ended the stream shortly after.</p><p>Newsom <a href="https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1878661950021960013?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">shared the exchange</a> in his own X post at the time, saying Musk was "exposed by firefighters."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/spencer-pratt-enlists-sen-rick-scott-federal-investigation-california-wildfire-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SPENCER PRATT ENLISTS SEN.

The immense loss of homes in LA is primarily due to: 1. Nonsensical overregulation that prevented creating fire breaks and doing brush clearing. 2. Bad governance at the state and local level that resulted in a shortage of water."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-calls-trumps-claims-pure-fiction-after-president-elect-points-finger-over-california-fire-tragedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NEWSOM CALLS TRUMP'S CLAIMS ‘PURE FICTION’ AFTER PRESIDENT-ELECT POINTS FINGER OVER CALIFORNIA FIRE TRAGEDY</u></strong></a></p><p>Trump, who was president-elect at the time, <a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/wildfires/2025/01/la-fires-donald-trump-fact-check/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alleged in a Truth Social post</a> that water shortages were largely due to Newsom's failure to "sign the water restoration declaration" that would have "allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way."</p><p>Trump's remarks prompted Newsom's office to fire back, insisting that the alleged declaration was "pure fiction."</p><p>"For the first time in history, we have a president that is promoting [misinformation] in the middle of these disasters, in the middle of emergencies where lives are quite literally on the line, and people are buying the bulls---, hook-line and sinker," Newsom told Soboroff, reflecting on how many people believed Trump’s claims.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a>'s request for comment.</p><p><i>Fox News' Alexandra Koch contributed to this report.</i></p>
