A man who appeared to be one of the protesters walked into frame from behind a white SUV.</p><p>The man, wearing a bright orange construction vest and holding a handheld radio, raised his hands and stepped in front of the trooper.</p><p>The trooper can be heard on camera shouting, "Move!

"That right, however, does not include entering active roadways or placing themselves in danger.</p><p>"In this case, video clearly shows the individual holding onto the front of the trooper’s vehicle, lying down, then standing back up afterward and leaving the scene under his own power," the statement continued. "At no point does the video show the individual being run over or injured, despite the narratives circulating on social media."</p><p>The agency added that its priority is public safety for protesters, motorists and troopers.</p><p>"When someone enters the roadway, it creates a serious and immediate risk, and troopers are trained to respond to prevent injuries or worse outcomes," the agency added.</p>
