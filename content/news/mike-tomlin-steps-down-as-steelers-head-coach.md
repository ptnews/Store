<p>Mike Tomlin, after 19 NFL seasons and one Super Bowl championship, stepped down as the head coach of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>.</p><p>Tomlin’s decision came hours after the Steelers suffered an AFC Wild Card defeat to the Houston Texans on Monday night. The Steelers’ offense couldn’t break through the Texans’ tough defense even while forcing the Texans’ offense to turn the ball over three times.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>He was the first Steelers coach to have a nine-year stretch without a playoff win. However, he also never had a losing season as head coach. Pittsburgh won eight AFC North titles and captured the Super Bowl in Tomlin’s second season as head coach.</p><p>Steelers fans had grown tired of Tomlin toward the back half of last season as the team finished 10-7 and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/texans-defense-suffocates-aaron-rodgers-steelers-playoff-win" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost in the Wild Card Round</a>. He managed to coach his team through multiple injuries and the late arrival of Aaron Rodgers to the roster to guide the team to another 10-7 record. But with the same result, fans made their voices heard as they were losing to the Texans.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/steelers-aaron-rodgers-walks-out-press-conference-after-defending-mike-tomlin-from-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STEELERS' AARON RODGERS WALKS OUT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER DEFENDING MIKE TOMLIN FROM CRITICISM</strong></a></p><p>"During our meeting today, Coach Tomlin informed me that he has decided to step down as our Head Coach," Steelers president Art Rooney II said in a statement. "Obviously, I am extremely grateful to Mike for all the hard work, dedication and success we have shared over the last 19 years. It is hard for me to put into words the level of respect and appreciation I have for Coach Tomlin. He guided the franchise to our sixth Super Bowl championship and made the playoffs 13 times during his tenure, including winning the AFC North eight times in his career. His track record of never having a losing season in 19 years will likely never be duplicated.</p><p>"My family and I, and everyone connected to Steelers management, are forever grateful for the passion and dedication Mike Tomlin has devoted to Steelers football."</p><p>Tomllin later released a statement.</p><p>"After much thought and reflection, I have decided to step down as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers," he said.</p><p>"This organization has been a huge part of my life for many years, and it has been an absolute honor to lead this team. I am deeply grateful to Art Rooney II and the late Ambassador Rooney for their trust and support. I am also thankful to the players who gave everything they had every day, and to the coaches and staff whose commitment and dedication made this journey so meaningful.</p><p>"I want to also thank Steelers Nation. Your passion, loyalty, and high expectations represent what makes this franchise truly special. Coaching in Pittsburgh is unlike anywhere else, and I will always take great pride in having been a steward of this team.</p><p>"While this chapter comes to a close, my respect and love for the Pittsburgh Steelers will never change. I am excited for what the future holds for this organization, and I will forever be grateful for my time coaching in Pittsburgh."</p><p>What happens next for Tomlin is very much up in the air. He’s been linked to potential <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL head-coaching jobs</a> in a cycle that’s already been wacky. He’s also been linked as potential TV commentator should he forgo going back on the sideline.</p><p>For the Steelers, the organization will have to decide who will fill the shoes of a coach that continued its dynastic run. The team had Chuck Noll from 1969 to 1991 and Bill Cowher from 1992 to 2007.</p><p>The next Steelers head coach will be expected to continue building up on the foundation that was laid by Noll and continued by his successors.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
