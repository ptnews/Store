<p>Former "Saturday Night Live" star Bowen Yang and his fellow podcast host Matt Rogers walked back critical comments they made earlier this week <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-snl-star-agrees-dont-waste-your-money-supporting-jasmine-crockett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about Rep. Jasmine Crockett</a>, D-Texas, after the pair faced backlash online for questioning her Senate run.</p><p>"I hear the response, and I am taking every bit of it to heart, I promise," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/mattrogerstho/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rogers wrote in an Instagram post.</a> "Transparency and candor matter to me, especially on the podcast. I’m a very progressive person who cares deeply about winning these elections, but my phrasing was not right. I will be more thoughtful! I really do promise." </p><p>"I have great respect and admiration for Rep. Crockett, and I regret that my words suggested otherwise. I just want us to win, and I will be better at finding ways to help," he added. </p><p>Yang shared Rogers' Instagram story on Saturday, writing, "should not have cursorily weighed in on this. Understanding the platform and will use it more responsibly."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-carville-blasts-crockett-breaking-first-rule-politics-focusing-herself-more-than-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JAMES CARVILLE BLASTS CROCKETT FOR BREAKING 'FIRST RULE OF POLITICS' FOCUSING ON HERSELF MORE THAN VOTERS</strong></a></p><p>Rogers and Yang appeared to criticize Crockett during their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAodYSz02Xk&amp;list=RDaAodYSz02Xk&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"Las Culturistas" podcast</a> on Wednesday. Rogers first called out California Gov. Gavin Newsom, labeling him and other politicians as self-focused before including Crockett in that category. He told listeners they shouldn't "waste" money donating to her Texas Senate campaign.</p><p>"Anytime a politician is making it too obviously about themselves, I'm already done," Rogers said. "And don't waste your money sending to Jasmine Crockett. Do not do it."</p><p>Yang then said, "I must agree."</p><p>"Don't do it. Don't. You're going to waste your money. Take it from someone who sent Sara Gideon a ton of money in Maine. Just don't do it. Don't waste your money. Don't do it," Rogers added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/crockett-fires-back-jd-vances-street-girl-comments-says-its-racist-trope" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CROCKETT FIRES BACK AT JD VANCE'S 'STREET GIRL' COMMENTS, SAYS IT'S A RACIST TROPE</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fierce-trump-critic-jasmine-crockett-shakes-up-high-stakes-senate-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crockett announced in December</a> that she would run in the Texas Senate Democratic primary against state Rep. James Talarico, D-Texas.</p><p>Rogers later clarified he meant nothing personal against Crockett but argued she was too "well-defined" politically to win a statewide or national race.</p><p>"She's not going to win a Senate seat in Texas, you guys," Rogers said. "Like, if Beto O’Rourke couldn't do it, Jasmine Crockett is not going to do it."</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</strong></a></p><p>Other Democrats <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/house-democrats-voice-concerns-over-jasmine-crocketts-texas-senate-campaign-viability-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have voiced concerns</a> about Crockett’s ability to win statewide in Texas.</p><p>"She might win a primary, but she ain't winning a general in Texas," one senior <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/12/jasmine-crockett-house-democrats-senate-texas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>House Democrat told Axios</u></a>.</p><p>"It's concerning for [swing] districts...
