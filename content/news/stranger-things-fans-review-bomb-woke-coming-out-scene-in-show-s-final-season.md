<p>Critics are review-bombing "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/stranger-things" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stranger Things</a>'" penultimate episode, calling character Will Byers’ coming-out scene "cringey" and accusing the creators of prioritizing politics over storytelling.</p><p>In the show's most recent episode, "The Bridge," Will gathers all his friends and family for a tearful confession, telling them that he's just like his friends in almost every way – except, he says, "I don't like girls." Fans noted that the timing of his monologue seemed odd and forced, as the cast was in the middle of trying to defeat Vecna, the series' villain.</p><p>"Woke ruins everything," one <a href="https://x.com/JonnyRoot_/status/2004745807090589752" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">user wrote</a> on X, blasting the development as "LGBTQ+ nonsense."</p><p>"Netflix decided to RUIN their most popular show of all-time, Stranger Things, by focusing their final season on Will coming out as a homosexual, promoting the propaganda that Will’s superpowers are because he’s ‘embraced his sexuality’ &amp; the villain telling Will that his friends won’t like him if they find out he likes dudes…" he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/pentagon-condemns-netflixs-gay-military-series-boots-woke-garbage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PENTAGON CONDEMNS NETFLIX'S GAY MILITARY SERIES 'BOOTS' AS 'WOKE GARBAGE'</strong></a></p><p>Another user said, "How did Stranger Things go from such a great show to the only way they could defeat Vecna is if Will tells everyone he’s gay first."</p><p>Brandon Leslie, founder and CEO of Florida's Voice and RightLine news, also weighed in by seizing on a tweet that discussed creators Matt and Ross Duffer's <a href="https://gayety.com/the-duffer-brothers-stranger-things-final-season" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">intent for the scene</a>, more specifically that Byers had to face his fears and accept himself in order to fully face Vecna.</p><p>"Netflix is doubling down on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushing the gay agenda</a> – the 16-year-old boy couldn't kill a dark magic demon unless he came out of the closet," he wrote, adding, "Horrible and forced."</p><p>The now-infamous scene wasn't the only source of upset, as other fans critiqued the final season's pacing, acting, plot and more.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netflix-set-air-transgender-coal-miner-film-queen-coal-december" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NETFLIX SET TO AIR TRANSGENDER COAL MINER FILM 'QUEEN OF COAL' IN DECEMBER</strong></a></p><p>One user likened the latest season to "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/game-of-thrones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game of Thrones</a>," arguing that both were too rushed to adequately complete the story.</p><p>"This series finale of Stranger Things is giving me Game of Thrones vibes. Too much hype, too long of a hiatus and it feels so rushed. Ending it in 8 episodes also just feels… meh," <a href="https://x.com/RichardOcho/status/2005692246725964027" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the user said</a>.</p><p>A second person chimed in by saying, "Stranger Things has genuinely become so f------ stupid. Terrible plot. Terrible cliché lazy writing. Terrible acting," adding, "Why am I wasting my time with this s---."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/netflix-executives-pro-transgender-social-media-posts-surface-during-kids-content-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NETFLIX EXECUTIVE'S PRO-TRANSGENDER SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS SURFACE DURING KID'S CONTENT CONTROVERSY</strong></a></p><p>Netflix did not immediately respond to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital's</a> request for comment.</p><p>Per <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/29/entertainment/stranger-things-5-fans-bash-woke-scene-with-will-coming-out-as-gay/?utm_social_handle_id=17469289&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_social_post_id=636670850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Post</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/millie-bobby-brown-dazzles-dramatic-outfit-change-final-stranger-things-premiere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the show's fifth season</a> has become its lowest rated on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/stranger_things/s05" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, sinking to a 56% audience score rating from 73% after Volume 2's release.</p><p>Positive reviews also abounded for both the scene and the fifth season, however, with some praising Will Byers as the best character and offering a positive reception of him for facing his fear.</p><p>"Will Byers is for the fans," <a href="https://x.com/agentnovazo/status/2005688090174841235" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">one account wrote</a>, tacking on the hashtag, "#protectwillbyersfromhomophobia."</p><p>Another shared two photos of the character with the same hashtag and the caption, "The core of Stranger Things! Will Byers is the best character and deserves nothing but happiness!!"</p><p>A third user urged fans dissatisfied with the outcome to put aside their grievances and enjoy the rest of the wildly popular show.</p><p>"We all grew up with this show and it’s now truly coming to an end. So even if you were not satisfied with Volume 2 that shouldn’t erase what the show meant to us. This is still goodbye so remember why you liked it to begin with," <a href="https://x.com/mikewheelerxst/status/2005692826366140575" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">they wrote</a>.</p>
