<p>A mama turtle has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressed researchers</a> after making a rare 7,000-mile journey in seven months, swimming from the warm waters of Panama to the North Atlantic before returning to Florida.</p><p>Riptide, a female leatherback turtle <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/caribbean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the Caribbean</a>, was tagged and released off the coast of Panama on May 22. </p><p>Since then, Sea Turtle Conservancy, an organization based in Gainesville, Florida, has been tracking the turtle's long and impressive journey. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/archaeologists-unearth-chilling-16th-century-gallows-where-rebels-were-hanged-displayed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH CHILLING 16TH-CENTURY GALLOWS WHERE REBELS WERE HANGED AND DISPLAYED</u></strong></a></p><p>Riptide reached Turks and Caicos on July 11, and nearly saw the coast of Nova Scotia on Sept. 14.</p><p>She then moved south and was spotted near Fire Island, New York, on Nov. 23 before making her way south, hitting 7,000 miles by Jan. 11.</p><p>David Godfrey, the executive director of the Sea Turtle Conservancy, told Fox News Digital that Riptide is one of the first turtles his organization has seen take such a trip.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Riptide is one of the first turtles we have tracked from Panama that went all the way to the North Atlantic and then back down to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coast of Florida</a> in a bit over seven months," said Godfrey.</p><p>"Her 7,000-mile migration is not the longest we have seen, but it is definitely up there for less than a year."</p><p>Riptide is currently swimming in the waters outside of Jacksonville, and Godfrey predicts that she'll move down to Panama, where she hatched and nested 93 fertile eggs last year. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"It would be unusual for her to nest two years in a row," Godfrey observed. "More likely, she will continue to migrate around looking for food until she returns to the Caribbean in 2027."</p><p>He added, "Turtles do their own thing, and it will be fun to watch and see if she surprises us back in Panama this summer."</p><p>Officials aren't sure how old the long-distance swimmer is, but Godfrey said she's at least 15 years old — and "could be quite a bit older than that."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Sea Turtle Conservancy (STC), the oldest <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/reptiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sea turtle</a> research and conservation group in the world, carries out efforts across Central America, the Caribbean and the Sunshine State.</p><p>Godfrey added that leatherbacks have almost no predators once they're fully grown, except for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/sharks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large sharks</a> — but their greatest threat is human activity. </p><p>"Unfortunately, we humans are their greatest threat, usually from inadvertently impacting them through commercial fishing activities, boat strikes and disturbance of their habitat," he said.</p><p>"There is also a significant amount of poaching of eggs and even some adult turtles when they come back to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/beach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the nesting beach</a>, which are the kinds of things STC works very hard to curtail."</p>
