<p>Independent journalist Nick Sortor criticized the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legacy media</a> on Monday, alleging chaotic "riot" conditions in Minneapolis have largely gone unreported.</p><p>"It's been a riot since day one… they've been trying to cover it up," Sortor told "Jesse Watters Primetime" guest host Charlie Hurt.</p><p>"The legacy media, in particular, they don't want to show what's actually going on out here. I have to do this live shot from several blocks away," he added, pointing to police lights in the distance. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-allegedly-assaulted-flagpole-minneapolis-anti-ice-agitators-violent-parking-garage-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MAN ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTED WITH FLAGPOLE BY MINNEAPOLIS ANTI-ICE AGITATORS IN VIOLENT PARKING GARAGE ATTACK</strong></a></p><p>"But I can't go over there anymore because I will be attacked, even with police lights over there. That is not a protest."</p><p>Sortor shared a harrowing experience on social media earlier this month when anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agitators swarmed his vehicle, shouting at him and yelling expletives.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minneapolis-ice-shooting-officer-followed-training-potentially-deadly-threat-drove-him-former-agent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MINNEAPOLIS ICE SHOOTING OFFICER FOLLOWED TRAINING AS POTENTIALLY 'DEADLY THREAT' DROVE AT HIM: FORMER AGENT</u></strong></a></p><p>He said the agitators hurled frozen water bottles in his direction, smashed his windows and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/terror/vandalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vandalized the vehicle</a> with spray paint.</p><p>Sortor said his camera was also stolen and claimed that, despite the crime, he was forced to leave the area instead of the perpetrator.</p><p>"It's crazy to me that this is the point that we're at. We are on our own out here, and we have to take our cities back. We cannot allow no-go zones to be set up in otherwise beautiful states like this."</p><p>Tensions have brewed in Minneapolis since the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-says-walz-frey-incited-chaos-after-anti-ice-mob-storms-minneapolis-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE-involved death of 37-year-old Renee</a> Nicole Good after she appeared to accelerate her car in an agent's direction earlier this month.</p><p><i>Fox News' Ashley Carnahan contributed to this report.</i></p>
