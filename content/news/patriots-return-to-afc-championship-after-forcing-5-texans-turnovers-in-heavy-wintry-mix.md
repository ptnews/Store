<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New England Patriots</a> are back.</p><p>From 2001 to 2018, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13 AFC Championship Games</a> featured the Pats, including in each of the final eight seasons of that stretch. </p><p>After six seasons without them, New England is back to what feels like home.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>Thanks to forcing five turnovers against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/houston-texans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houston Texans</a>, the Pats took home a 28-16 victory in the divisional round on Sunday.</p><p>The Patriots were aggressive early, going for it on fourth-and-1 from the Houston 28 in winter weather, and it worked out with a 28-yard touchdown pass to Demario Douglas. The Texans had to settle for a field goal after a rushing touchdown by Woody Marks was called back because of an illegal shift.</p><p>Houston took a 10-7 lead with a Christian Kirk touchdown early in the second quarter, and the Texans were in business after forcing a Patriots punt. But the momentum was short-lived after C.J. Stroud threw a pick-six — his second of four interceptions in the first half — to give New England the lead. After a Houston punt, Drake Maye found Stefon Diggs to make it 21-10 with 3:12 to go.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/texas-star-azeez-al-shaair-fined-pro-palestine-message-eye-black-report"><strong>TEXANS STAR AZEEZ AL-SHAAIR FINED FOR PRO-PALESTINIAN MESSAGE ON EYE BLACK: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>Houston kicked two field goals in the third quarter to make it a five-point game, all while the Patriots offense stalled. But in the fourth quarter, Maye hit Kayshon Boutte on a deep ball, and the receiver made an incredible diving grab in the end zone to go up 28-16 with 12:58 left.</p><p>Stroud struggled from the jump and finished by completing just 42.6% of his passes (20-for-47) for 212 yards.</p><p>After an MVP-caliber season, Maye's numbers weren't outstanding, as he posted just 179 yards on 16-of-27 passing and three turnovers himself, but with the help of his defense, he is filling the shoes of Tom Brady quite nicely.</p><p>It will be the Pats against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denver Broncos</a> next week for a trip to the Super Bowl, a rematch of the AFC Championship 10 years ago between Brady and Peyton Manning. </p><p>That season, the quarterbacks had been in the league for a combined 33 seasons — this season is both Maye and Bo Nix's second. Although, after Nix's injury late on Saturday, it'll likely be Jarrett Stidham starting for Denver.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a></p>
