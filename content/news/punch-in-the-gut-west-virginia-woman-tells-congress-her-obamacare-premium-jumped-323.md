<p>A West Virginia woman told lawmakers Tuesday that her Obamacare premium jumped 323%, calling the increase a "punch in the gut" as Congress grilled <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health insurance</a> CEOs over rising costs and the future of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>"Last month, I did what millions of Americans and tens of thousands of West Virginians did. I went online to re-enroll through HealthCare.gov, the ACA marketplace," said Ellen Allen, a 64-year-old from French, West Virginia.</p><p>"When I saw my new premium, I felt a pit in my stomach. I expected an increase, but it was a punch in the gut to see my premium had jumped 323%," she told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/expired-obamacare-subsidy-deal-inches-toward-senate-floor-vote-amid-bipartisan-talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EXPIRED OBAMACARE SUBSIDY DEAL INCHES TOWARD SENATE FLOOR VOTE AMID BIPARTISAN TALKS</strong></a></p><p>Allen said she paid just under $500 a month last year for a bronze plan that included vision and dental coverage, which came out to about $6,000 annually.</p><p>"I liked that plan and it was somewhat affordable, even with a high deductible and a $9,200 maximum out-of-pocket cost," she said.</p><p>But the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits sent her monthly premium soaring to nearly $2,000, without vision or dental insurance. Over a year, that eye-watering cost equals the price of a reliable used car.</p><p>"That’s a lot to ask of a hardworking American who has worked every day of her adult and teen life," she told lawmakers. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-jim-justice-says-republicans-lousy-knowing-what-everyday-americans-think-about-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SEN JIM JUSTICE SAYS REPUBLICANS ARE 'LOUSY' AT KNOWING WHAT EVERYDAY AMERICANS THINK ABOUT HEALTHCARE</u></strong></a></p><p>The tax credits, which expired at the start of the year, have driven higher health care costs for millions of Americans who buy coverage on their own — including self-employed workers, small business owners and ranchers who do not qualify for Medicaid or Medicare.</p><p>"Millions of Americans, including 67,000 West Virginians, have been able to afford market-based coverage thanks to the enhanced premium tax credits," Allen said, adding that the subsidies kept people insured, kept small business owners covered and kept families healthy.</p><p>Allen warned that the loss of those tax credits is forcing families to make painful financial trade-offs.</p><p>"There’s nothing fair about a system that makes us choose between saving for retirement or dipping into savings to pay for a life-preserving procedure or, as several people I know are doing, dropping health insurance altogether and rolling the dice."</p><p>She called on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawmakers </a>to reverse course.</p><p>"This is fixable. Congress can act now to restore and make permanent the ACA’s expanded premium tax credits. Doing so would save lives, protect families, and strengthen our economy."</p><p>The loss of the enhanced ACA subsidies comes as the Trump administration pushes to rein in costs nationwide, with a high-stakes <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">midterm </a><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election </a>year sharpening the political stakes around health care affordability.</p>
