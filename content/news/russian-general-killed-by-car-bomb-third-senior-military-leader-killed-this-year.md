<p>A Russian general was killed in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">car bombing in Moscow</a> on Monday, with investigators saying they suspect Ukrainian intelligence may have been behind the attack.</p><p>The bombing targeted Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, and he died from his injuries. He was the third senior Russian military officer to be killed in a bombing this year.</p><p>"Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services," said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia's Investigative Committee.</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vladimir Putin</a> had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-rejects-key-parts-us-peace-plan-kremlin-official-warns-europe-faces-new-war-risk-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PUTIN REJECTS KEY PARTS OF US PEACE PLAN AS KREMLIN OFFICIAL WARNS EUROPE FACES NEW WAR RISK: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria, according to Russia's defense ministry.</p><p>Ukrainian forces have yet to take responsibility for the attack.</p><p>Prior to Sarvarov, Russia lost the head of its nuclear, biological and chemical protection force, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, in a similar bombing earlier this year. Ukrainian forces took responsibility for that attack.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-derides-european-leaders-he-insists-russias-war-goals-ukraine-met-force-diplomacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PUTIN DERIDES EUROPEAN LEADERS AS HE INSISTS RUSSIA'S WAR GOALS IN UKRAINE WILL BE MET BY FORCE OR DIPLOMACY</strong></a></p><p>Russian military officer Lt.

Russian officials said they were proceeding "constructively" on Sunday, even as missiles rained down on Ukraine's port city of Odesa.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Putin</u></a> also noted on Friday that the nation's "troops are advancing," and expressed confidence that Russia would achieve its goals by military force if Ukraine does not accept its peace terms.</p><p>"The goals of the special military operation will undoubtedly be achieved. We would prefer to accomplish this and address the root causes of the conflict through diplomatic means," he said.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
