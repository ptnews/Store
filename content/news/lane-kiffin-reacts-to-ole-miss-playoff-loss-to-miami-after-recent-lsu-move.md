<p>Lane Kiffin was not allowed to coach <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/ole-miss-rebels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ole Miss</a> in the college football playoffs after ditching the team for LSU, but he was sure tuned into his former squad.</p><p>One reason may have been that he stood to earn bonuses for every playoff win the Rebels had this year, which <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his new school, LSU,</a> is honoring.</p><p>In any case,  the Rebels first-ever playoff run ended in heartbreak Thursday with a 31-27 loss to No. 10 Miami.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>There's no love lost for Kiffin with Rebels fans, or even their players, but Kiffin appears to still have a soft spot for the football program.</p><p>"Amazing effort and grit @OleMissFB (crying emoji). best season ever in the history of Ole Miss!! Love guys," Kiffin <a href="https://x.com/Lane_Kiffin/status/2009498536791167151" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">posted to X</a> after the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/indiana-coach-curt-cignetti-wanted-1-thing-after-historic-victory-over-oregon"><strong>INDIANA COACH CURT CIGNETTI WANTED 1 THING AFTER HISTORIC VICTORY OVER OREGON</strong></a></p><p>After Carson Beck scampered for a score with 18 seconds left, Ole Miss had one last miraculous effort as Trinidad Chambliss threw a deep ball into the end zone. It fell incomplete, but there was speculation about whether a defensive pass interference should have been called.</p><p>Kiffin was hoping for a flag.</p><p>"Pass interference 100!!!" <a href="https://x.com/Lane_Kiffin/status/2009498762075615711" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kiffin wrote</a>.</p><p>The Rebels found themselves in coach limbo throughout the playoffs, as many assistants are following Kiffin to Baton Rouge.
