<p>A Catholic legal group has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California law</a> that prevents public schools from notifying parents of transgender students' gender identities.</p><p>The Thomas More Society filed an emergency appeal on Thursday asking the Supreme Court to reinstate a ruling issued last month by a federal judge who said parents with religious objections can opt out of the law’s restrictions. The challenged provisions bar teachers from informing parents if a student wishes to change their pronouns or gender identity, according to reporting by POLITICO.</p><p>"Parents only relinquish authority needed for the school to carry out its 'educational mission' ... they do not delegate the authority to make decisions regarding whether their child is a boy or a girl," attorneys for the Thomas More Society wrote in the appeal.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/federal-judge-strikes-down-gender-secrecy-policies-california-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FEDERAL JUDGE STRIKES DOWN 'GENDER SECRECY' POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS</strong></a></p><p>The law, signed into law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2024 and in effect for the past year, also bars teachers from disclosing a student's sexual orientation. That provision, however, is not directly at issue in the current legal challenge. </p><p>The measure was adopted after several <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school districts</a> in the Golden State implemented policies requiring teachers to contact parents if students wanted to change their name, pronouns or gender identity – policies that critics labeled "forced outing." </p><p>The law allows disclosure of a student's gender identity in "compelling" circumstances, a standard opponents argue is vague and insufficient. </p><p>There are exceptions under the law allowing schools to disclose a student’s gender identity in "compelling" circumstances.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez issued a permanent injunction last month blocking parts of the law, siding with two Escondido Union School District teachers — Elizabeth Mirabelli and Lori Ann West — who argued their district’s policies violated their constitutional and religious rights.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/oregon-educators-win-650k-settlement-after-school-district-fired-them-over-gender-policy-comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>OREGON EDUCATORS WIN 650K SETTLEMENT AFTER SCHOOL DISTRICT FIRED THEM OVER GENDER POLICY COMMENTS</u></strong></a></p><p>"Parents have a right to receive gender information and teachers have a right to provide to parents accurate information about a child’s gender identity," Benitez wrote in the ruling. "Parents and guardians have a federal constitutional right to be informed if their public school student child expresses gender incongruence." </p><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later paused Benitez’s ruling while California appeals the decision, keeping the law in effect for now.</p><p>In addition to seeking emergency relief from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nation's highest court</a>, lawyers challenging the law said they plan to ask a larger panel of Ninth Circuit judges to allow Benitez’s injunction to take effect.</p><p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said the state would continue defending the law.</p><p>"We look forward to continuing to make our case in court," a spokesperson for Bonta’s office told POLITICO.</p><p>The case comes amid broader scrutiny of California’s education policies. In March, the Trump administration announced the Education Department had launched an investigation into the state’s enforcement of the law.</p>
