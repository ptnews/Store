<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/illinois" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois residents</a> are once again being reminded how fragile government data systems can be. The Illinois Department of Human Services has confirmed a data breach that exposed sensitive records belonging to roughly 700,000 people.</p><p>The breach is believed to have exposed two distinct sets of records. One is personal and program-related data tied to more than 672,000 Medicaid and Medicare Savings Program recipients, including addresses, case numbers, demographic details and medical assistance plan names, and another 32,000 Division of Rehabilitation Services customers whose names, addresses, case details and referral information were also exposed over multiple years.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

The affected data was connected to individuals who interacted with DHS programs, which can include benefits, assistance services and support programs across the state.</p><p>According to the agency, the breach involved personally identifiable information. While officials have not publicly released every technical detail, DHS confirmed that sensitive records were accessed, prompting notifications to impacted individuals. As is typical in cases like this, the investigation is ongoing, and the full scope of how the intrusion occurred is still being reviewed.</p><p>For residents, the key issue is not just that data was accessed, but the type of data DHS holds. Government agencies like DHS often store names, addresses, dates of birth, case numbers and, in some instances, Social Security numbers or benefits-related information. Once that data escapes, it can be misused in ways that last for years.</p><p>When a private company is breached, you can often change a password or close an account. Government data is different. You can't change your Social Security number easily. You can't erase past interactions with public assistance programs. That makes breaches involving state agencies particularly dangerous.</p><p>Exposed records can be used for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identity theft,</a> fraudulent benefit claims, phishing scams and long-term impersonation. Criminals often combine government data with information from other breaches to build detailed profiles that make scams far more convincing. Even if there's no immediate misuse, stolen data frequently resurfaces months or years later.</p><p>As with many large breaches, DHS has stated that it is taking steps to secure its systems and prevent similar incidents in the future. That's an expected response. But for affected residents, the burden of protection now shifts largely to you.</p><p>We reached out to the Illinois Department of Human Services for comment, but did not receive a response before our deadline.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/january-scams-surge-why-fraud-spikes-start-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>JANUARY SCAMS SURGE: WHY FRAUD SPIKES AT THE START OF THE YEAR</u></strong></a></p><p>If you received a notification from Illinois DHS, or if you've ever interacted with DHS programs, these steps can help reduce your risk.</p><p>If DHS provides free identity monitoring or credit protection, sign up. These services can alert you to suspicious activity involving your Social Security number or credit file before the damage spreads. Beyond basic monitoring, full identity theft services can help with recovery, paperwork and financial reimbursement if fraud occurs. This can be especially useful after large-scale government breaches.</p><p>Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email address,</a> and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.</p><p>See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p>A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account. If your personal data is leaked, attackers often try the same credentials across multiple services. Unique passwords stop one breach from turning into many.</p><p>Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see <strong>Cyberguy.com</strong>) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.</p><p>Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at<i><strong><u> Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p>Strong antivirus tools do more than scan files. They monitor suspicious behavior, phishing attempts and malicious links that often follow large data breaches. This matters because breach victims are frequently targeted with follow-up scams.</p><p>The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/software" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong antivirus software</a> installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.</p><p>Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p>A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before opening new accounts. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new credit entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is often the safest option.</p><p>Once your information leaks, it often spreads to data broker sites that sell personal details. Personal data removal services work to request takedowns and reduce how much of your information is publicly available. While they can't erase everything, they significantly lower your exposure.</p><p>While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the dark web,</a> making it harder for them to target you.</p><p>Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><strong>Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: </strong><i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p>After breaches involving government agencies, scammers often pretend to be state officials, benefits offices, or support hotlines. Don't click links or share information unless you independently verify the source through official websites or phone numbers.</p><p>You're entitled to free credit reports from major credit bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, inquiries, or address changes. Early detection makes identity theft far easier to contain.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/covenant-health-data-breach-affects-nearly-500000-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>COVENANT HEALTH DATA BREACH AFFECTS NEARLY 500,000 PATIENTS</u></strong></a></p><p>Even government agencies are not immune to large-scale security failures. When nearly 700,000 residents are affected, the impact goes far beyond a single system or department. While DHS works through its investigation, protecting your identity now depends largely on the steps you take next. Acting early, layering protections and staying vigilant can make the difference between a breach being an inconvenience or a long-term nightmare.</p><p>Do you trust state agencies to protect your personal data?
