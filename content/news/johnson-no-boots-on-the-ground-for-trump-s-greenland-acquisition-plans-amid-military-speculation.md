<p>House Speaker <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Johnson</a>, R-La., pushed back on the idea that the U.S. would intervene militarily in Greenland, saying he does not anticipate war or U.S. troops being deployed there.</p><p>Johnson told <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5686591-speaker-johnson-greenland-troops/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Hill</a> there is no declaration of war pending for Greenland and said he does not expect any boots on the ground.</p><p>"We’ve been very clear. I mean, the Article 1 branch is clear. There’s no declaration of war pending for Greenland," Johnson said. "It’s just not a thing. I don’t anticipate any boots on the ground anywhere, anytime soon."</p><p>Johnson echoed the foreign policy objectives of President Trump, noting the administration views Greenland as strategically important to U.S. interests.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/stephen-miller-dismisses-idea-denmark-would-fight-greenland-claims-should-part-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STEPHEN MILLER DISMISSES THE IDEA DENMARK WOULD FIGHT FOR GREENLAND, CLAIMS IT SHOULD BE PART OF THE US</strong></a></p><p>"Look, there are negotiations. There is interest in Greenland. For U.S. interests, America’s first interest," Johnson said.</p><p>"It has to do with national security and critical minerals and many other reasons. And we’ve long acknowledged that," he added.</p><p>Trump has made acquiring <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenland</a> a key strategic and national security objective, warning last week that if the United States does not acquire the territory, superpowers Russia or China could move in.</p><p>He said Sunday the U.S. must acquire Greenland — not lease it — arguing the Arctic territory lacks adequate defenses and warning that Russia or China would move in if Washington does not act, a move he said is critical to U.S. and NATO security.</p><p>Greenland has rejected Trump’s repeated advances, and on Tuesday <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/greenlands-prime-minister-says-we-choose-denmark-over-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the island’s prime minister</a> said the country would prefer to remain part of Denmark rather than become a U.S. territory.</p><p>"We face a geopolitical crisis, and if we have to choose between the U.S. and Denmark here and now then we choose Denmark," Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said while appearing alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen at a joint press conference in Copenhagen.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-reportedly-considers-paying-each-greenland-resident-100k-us-takeover-talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ADMIN REPORTEDLY CONSIDERS PAYING EACH GREENLAND RESIDENT UP TO $100K AMID US TAKEOVER TALKS</strong></a></p><p>"We stand united in the Kingdom of Denmark."</p><p>Johnson’s comments come as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bipartisan-lawmakers-propose-bill-block-military-action-against-nato-members-amid-threats-take-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan lawmakers move to</a> restrict any unauthorized U.S. military action against NATO allies amid growing debate over Trump’s remarks about Greenland.</p><p>Rep. Bill Keating, D-Mass., is leading legislation that would block funding for military action taken without congressional approval, arguing the effort is aimed at preventing U.S. intervention against allied nations.</p><p>"This isn’t just about Greenland. This is about our security," Keating said.</p><p>The push follows Trump’s statement Friday that the U.S. would act on Greenland "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-us-making-moves-acquire-greenland-whether-like-not" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether they like it</a> or not," raising alarm among European leaders over a potential violation of NATO’s collective defense commitments.</p><p>The developments also come as Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, and Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, are expected to meet Wednesday with Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a> and Vice President JD Vance at the White House, according to Reuters.</p><p><i>Fox News’ Greg Norman and Landon Mion, as well as Reuters contributed to this report.</i></p>
