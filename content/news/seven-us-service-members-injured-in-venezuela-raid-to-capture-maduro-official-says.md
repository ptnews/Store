<p>Seven <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. service members</a> were injured in the Venezuela operation to capture Nicolás Maduro, an administration official told Fox News Digital Tuesday. </p><p>Five service members already have returned to duty and two are still recovering from the operation. </p><p>"They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery," the official said. "The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors."</p><p>On Saturday, service members landed in Caracas, Venezuela, during a secretive mission to strike Venezuelan territory and capture Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, known as Operation Absolute Resolve. The mission was led by the Army's elite special operations unit Delta Force. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maduro-appears-us-court-arraignment-questions-swirl-over-venezuelas-fate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEFIANT MADURO DECLARES HE IS A 'PRISONER OF WAR' IN FIRST US COURT APPEARANCE</strong></a></p><p>Officials said Tuesday that 24 Venezuelan security officials were killed during the raid, along with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/cubas-shadow-venezuela-havanas-intelligence-military-ties-exposed-after-maduro-raid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32 Cuban military and police officers</a>, who were responsible for guarding Maduro. </p><p>Venezuelan officials have claimed the operation also killed civilians, but those claims have not been independently verified. </p><p>Gen.
