<p>A former congressional IT aide is accused of abusing his trusted access to steal roughly 240 taxpayer-funded cellphones worth more than $150,000, shipping them to his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maryland home</a> and selling most of them at a pawn shop, federal prosecutors say.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice said Monday that Christopher Southerland, 43, of Glen Burnie, Md., was arrested and charged in a federal indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court, accusing him of stealing about 240 government-issued cellphones from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. House of Representatives.</a></p><p>According to evidence reviewed by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro and her office, Southerland worked from about April 2020 through July 2023 as a system administrator for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.</p><p>In that role, Southerland was authorized to order mobile devices for committee staff, prosecutors said, giving him direct access to the internal system used to procure government-issued phones.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/second-georgia-lawmaker-accused-ripping-off-taxpayers-pandemic-unemployment-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SECOND GEORGIA LAWMAKER ACCUSED OF RIPPING OFF TAXPAYERS WITH PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT FRAUD ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT</strong></a></p><p>From January 2023 through May 2023, Southerland allegedly used that authority to order <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/smartphones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 240 new cellphones</a> and have them shipped directly to his home, despite the committee having only about 80 staff members at the time.</p><p>Prosecutors say Southerland later sold more than 200 of the phones to a nearby pawn shop, converting the government property into personal cash.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-charges-ex-georgia-democrat-lawmaker-allegedly-fraudulently-obtaining-covid-unemployment-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOJ CHARGES EX-GEORGIA DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER WITH ALLEGEDLY FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINING COVID UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS</strong></a></p><p>As part of the alleged scheme, Southerland instructed a pawn shop employee to sell the devices "in parts," investigators say, a move designed to bypass the House’s mobile device management software, which allows officials to remotely monitor and secure government phones.</p><p>The scheme began to unravel when one of the stolen phones was sold intact rather than dismantled, according to prosecutors.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walzs-long-running-fraud-scandal-puts-harris-campaign-judgment-under-scrutiny" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>WALZ’S LONG-RUNNING FRAUD SCANDAL PUTS HARRIS CAMPAIGN JUDGMENT UNDER SCRUTINY</u></strong></a></p><p>That device ultimately ended up listed on eBay and was purchased by an uninvolved buyer. When the buyer powered on the phone for the first time, a contact number for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House of Representatives Technology Service Desk</a> appeared on the screen, the DOJ said.</p><p>The buyer called the number, prompting House officials to investigate and discover that multiple phones ordered under Southerland’s account were unaccounted for, prosecutors said.</p><p>The case is being investigated by the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Capitol Police</a> and the FBI. It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jake Green for the District of Columbia, with assistance from other federal prosecutors.</p>
