Jay Collins is mounting a gubernatorial bid on Monday, joining the field of candidates vying to succeed second-term Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p><p>"I’m running for Governor because leadership is forged under pressure, not in soundbites. I served over 23 years in the United States military, mainly as a Green Beret, where accountability is real, decisions have consequences, and service comes before self. That experience shaped how I lead and why I believe public office is a public trust," Collins said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ron-desantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeSantis</a> — a Republican who cannot run for governor again 2026 — appointed Collins to serve as lieutenant governor in August, calling him "the Chuck Norris of Florida politics."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desantis-picks-the-chuck-norris-florida-politics-new-top-deputy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DESANTIS PICKS ‘THE CHUCK NORRIS OF FLORIDA POLITICS’ AS NEW TOP DEPUTY</strong></a></p><p>The lieutenant governor, who previously served as a state senator, is jumping into a GOP gubernatorial primary that also features contenders including Trump-backed candidate U.S. Rep.

In the Legislature and as Lieutenant Governor, I’ve worked alongside Governor Ron DeSantis to deliver results and advance a bold, conservative agenda. I did not come to chase headlines. I came to deliver results. Standing with law enforcement. Protecting communities. And to keep Florida strong," he noted.</p><p>Collins indicated that as governor he would be a "strong partner" for President Donald Trump.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-lt-gov-jay-collins-appears-take-shots-trump-backed-gubernatorial-candidate-byron-donalds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FLORIDA LT GOV JAY COLLINS APPEARS TO TAKE SHOTS AT TRUMP-BACKED GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE BYRON DONALDS</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p><p>"I’m running for Governor to keep Florida strong and to build on the legacy of leadership that has made our state the model for the nation.
