President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he spoke with Rodríguez by phone and praised her as a "terrific person."</p><p>"We discussed a lot of things and I think we’re <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting along very well with Venezuela</a>," he said.</p><p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado criticized Rodríguez as the Trump administration engages with the Maduro ally, arguing she does not represent the Venezuelan people.</p><p>"I want to insist on this: Delcy Rodríguez, yes, she’s a communist. She’s the main ally and representation of the Russian regime, the Chinese and the Iranians, but that’s not the Venezuelan people and that’s not the armed forces, as well," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/maria-corina-machado-details-gifting-trump-nobel-peace-prize-during-white-house-visit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machado said</a> at a Heritage Foundation event on Friday.</p><p>"So I am profoundly, profoundly confident that we will have an orderly transition. This is a complex phase we are in right now. Some of the dirty work is being done by them," she added. "But then, the result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela who is going to be the best ally the United States has ever had in the Americas."</p>
