<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/sophie-turner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Turner</a>'s work in the gym has paid off. </p><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/streaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Video</a> dropped a first look at Turner as Lara Croft in the live-action series "Tomb Raider," which is currently in production. </p><p>"My God… she looks like she stepped out of the games," one user wrote on X. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sophie-turner-trains-8-hours-day-five-days-week-intense-tomb-raider-role-preparation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SOPHIE TURNER TRAINS 'EIGHT HOURS A DAY, FIVE DAYS A WEEK' FOR INTENSE 'TOMB RAIDER' ROLE PREPARATION</strong></a></p><p><strong>"</strong>Sophie Turner as Lara Croft is genuinely so striking," another quipped. "I’ve got full faith this adaptation at Prime Video is going to be REALLY up my alley. I just can’t get over how phenomenal she looks."</p><p>"OH MY GOD! SHE LOOKS PERFECT! I didn't expected they would go with a look so classic!" one user commented on Instagram. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Cunningham asked. </p><p>"I've learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realized that it's much easier to kind of build muscle if you've ever worked out before in your life, which I never had, so it has taken me months and months and months to get into good shape," Turner admitted. "That's what I've learned."</p><p>When Cunningham asked if her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/game-of-thrones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Game of Thrones"</a> role helped at all, Turner said, "No, I was the cool queen who, like, didn't have to do that. I also just kind of was the one that got beat up, not the one doing the beating. So, it's quite nice to learn how to throw a punch and not just take it."</p>
