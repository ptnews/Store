She then changed her Instagram bio to read, "The first ever 20 year old to get pregnant," which now reads, "romis mom."</p><p>Maynard first won the hearts of Bachelor Nation when she appeared on season 15 of "The Bachelor," competing for Brad Womack's heart, finishing the season as the runner-up. She was then chosen as the lead for season eight of "The Bachelorette" in 2012, ending the season engaged to Jef Holm, though their engagement ended soon after.</p><p>"I always say I should not give anyone any 'Bachelor' and 'Bachelorette' tips because it has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/emily-maynard-says-time-on-bachelorette-was-a-train-wreck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kind of been a train wreck</a>, to be quite honest — my time on the show was a bit of a mess," Maynard told "Good Morning America" in January 2017.</p><p>She later added that the advice she would give to those on the show is to "just have fun" with it.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>When Maynard was 18, her fiancé, NASCAR driver Ricky Hendrick, died in a plane crash.

"I didn’t know if I was coming or going. I was lost. I went to therapists, but I knew nothing they would tell me was going to make me feel better. Mine was an issue of the heart that I needed to work out myself. And I knew that time would do that."</p><p>Maynard ended up finding love with Johnson after they met at church and started dating in January 2013, following her breakup with Holm.</p><p>The two of them got engaged a year later in January 2014 and tied the knot later that year in June.
