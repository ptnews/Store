<p>Mexico transferred 37 cartel members to the United States on Tuesday as the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration</a> intensifies pressure on foreign governments to dismantle drug trafficking networks.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mexican Security Minister</a> Omar García Harfuch said the detainees were "high-impact criminals" who posed "a real threat to the country’s security." With this latest transfer, Mexico has now sent 92 cartel figures to the U.S., he said.</p><p>Video released by Mexican authorities showed handcuffed prisoners surrounded by heavily armed, masked officers as they were loaded onto a military jet near Mexico City.</p><p>The group includes members of several major criminal organizations, including the Sinaloa cartel, Jalisco New Generation cartel, Beltrán-Leyva cartel, the Northeast cartel and remnants of the Zetas based in Tamaulipas along the Texas border. Mexican officials said all had pending cases in U.S. courts.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro-narco-case-echoes-us-history-targeting-alleged-foreign-drug-kingpins" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO’S NARCO CASE ECHOES US HISTORY OF TARGETING ALLEGED FOREIGN DRUG KINGPINS</strong></a></p><p>Among those transferred was María del Rosario Navarro Sánchez, the first Mexican national charged in the U.S. with providing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/terror/counter-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">material support to a terrorist organization</a> after allegedly conspiring with a cartel.</p><p>"This is Mexico resorting to extraordinary measures as pressure from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> increases," David Mora, a Mexico analyst with the International Crisis Group, told The Associated Press.</p><p>The move comes as President Donald Trump has sharpened his rhetoric against drug cartels, even floating the possibility of U.S. military action, following a recent U.S. operation in Venezuela that removed former President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nicolas-maduro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicolás Maduro</a>.</p><p>"We've knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water, and we are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-announces-expansion-drug-cartel-crackdown-issues-grim-warning-iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity</a> this month.

A second transfer in August included 26 cartel members from multiple organizations.</p><p>García Harfuch said the transfers were driven by public safety concerns, arguing that cartel leaders were continuing to run criminal operations from inside Mexican prisons.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
