<p>In the wake of an ICE shooting that killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, academics have joined the chorus of left-wing radicals seeking to abolish the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal law enforcement agency</a>.</p><p>"Abolishing ICE is the moderate position," said Victor Ray, an associate professor of sociology, criminology and African American studies at the University of Iowa.</p><p>In another social media post, Ray referred to the shooting, which killed 37-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-renee-nicole-good-woman-killed-minneapolis-ice-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renee Nicole Good,</a> as a "murder." Nobody has been charged with murder in the case.</p><p>He also reposted an inflammatory message from "Jeopardy!" host Ken Jennings, who said, "The 'prosecute the former regime at every level' candidate has my vote in 2028."</p><p><a class="c-link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GOT A SCOOP ON CAMPUS? SEND US A TIP HERE</strong></a></p><p>At George Washington University, associate professor David Karpf of the school's media and public affairs department, trashed the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a> in the wake of the shooting.</p><p>"Most days, it doesn’t really feel like this country is gonna make it," he said on Bluesky. "Today it doesn’t feel like it deserves to."</p><p>In response to a story by Minnesota Public Radio, which quoted federal agents as saying the ICE officer who shot Good was "fearing for his life," Karpf replied, "Let him tell that s--- to a jury and then rot in prison for the rest of his life."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/homan-vows-enforce-immigration-laws-twin-cities-without-apology-amid-mayor-opposition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOMAN VOWS TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS IN TWIN CITIES 'WITHOUT APOLOGY' AMID MAYOR OPPOSITION</strong></a></p><p>He also reposted Jennings' call to prosecute "the former regime" after President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> leaves office.</p><p>"I watched a video of government agents murdering a woman. It left me feeling shocked and sad, and I expressed that shock and sadness," Karpf told Fox News Digital. "I think enforcement of immigration law should not include government agents murdering unarmed citizens."</p><p>When prompted whether "murder" was the proper term, given that nobody has been charged with murder, Karpf clarified.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-condemns-alleged-attack-ice-agents-stuck-snow-minneapolis-act-domestic-terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NOEM CONDEMNS ALLEGED ATTACK ON ICE AGENTS STUCK IN SNOW IN MINNEAPOLIS AS 'ACT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM'</strong></a></p><p>"I watched what <i>appeared to me</i> to be a government agent murdering a woman. It left me feeling shocked and sad," he said.</p><p>Seva Gunitsky is an associate professor of political science at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/campus-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Toronto</a>, but clarified for Fox News Digital that he is a U.S. citizen.</p><p>"[A]bolish ICE is the moderate position to be honest. [W]hichever candidate promises to nuremberg the [ICE] agents has my vote at this point," he said on Bluesky.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wave-car-attacks-ice-agents-follows-incendiary-rhetoric-from-target-city-leaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WAVE OF CAR ATTACKS ON ICE AGENTS FOLLOWS INCENDIARY RHETORIC FROM TARGET-CITY LEADERS</strong></a></p><p>"Nuremberg" references the post-World War II trials of Nazis and Nazi collaborators, who were tried for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. A dozen Nazi leaders were hanged after the Nuremberg trials. Left-wing activists have long compared ICE agents to Nazis and the Gestapo.</p><p>"To 'nuremberg' the ICE agents means to put them on trial," Gunitsky told Fox News Digital. "Thank you for your attention to this matter."</p><p>Gunitsky did not respond when asked about what crimes ICE agents should be tried for. </p><p>The University of Toronto told Fox News Digital that Gunitsky's response was sufficient, and did not comment further.</p><p>George Washington University did not return a request for comment.</p><p>Neither Ray nor the University of Iowa returned requests for comment.</p>
