<p>Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had 3,026 assists in his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA</a> career, but one of his biggest assists came long after his retirement. </p><p>O’Neal, 53, is helping former professional basketball player Jordan Wilmore complete his lifelong dream of becoming the tallest police officer in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas.</a> O’Neal and Wilmore have more in common than being former basketball players; they are both over seven feet tall. </p><p>O’Neal, who stands at seven-foot one, is actually shorter than Wilmore, who is seven-foot three. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Wilmore was hoping to become a police officer in Kemah, Texas, but recently failed the state peace officer exam. Wilmore scored a 69, falling one point shy of the requisite 70 needed to pass, but plans to take it again.</p><p>"At first I was down, but I thought, you know, I’m still young. You fail, you get right back up. Can’t be too quick to quit," Wilmore said, according <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/shaquille-o-neil-tall-kemah-police-officer/285-da0e2629-5f62-427a-83f4-ec670515e287" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to KHOU.</a></p><p>Police Chief Raymond Garivey praised Wilmore’s determination.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/suns-guards-celebration-teammate-costs-him-25k-after-dropping-f-bomb-during-live-tv-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SUNS GUARD'S CELEBRATION WITH TEAMMATE COSTS HIM $25K AFTER DROPPING F-BOMB DURING LIVE TV INTERVIEW</strong></a></p><p>"In my 34-year career, I’ve seen others fail, but I also see others give up. Once they’re done, they’re done. That’s not the case here. He wants to serve," Garivey said, according to KHOU.</p><p>O’Neal heard about Wilmore’s attempt to become a police officer and reached out, agreeing to sponsor his next attempt at the police academy. The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15-time All-Star</a> will also have a custom-made car ready for Wilmore, to fit his large frame, when he passes the exam. </p><p>"I’m really thankful for him helping me out and being there, and being a mentor for helping me through this," Wilmore said.</p><p>O’Neal is a certified peace officer himself and knows the process. </p><p>"It actually took me five to seven years to graduate from the LA Sheriff’s Academy. I wanted to just let him know he’s got my full support. I’m going to be on you, brother, make sure you get it done," O’Neal said, according to KHOU.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
