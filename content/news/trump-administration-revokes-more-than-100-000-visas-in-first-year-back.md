<p><strong>FIRST ON FOX:</strong> The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Department</a> revoked more than 100,000 foreign visas in 2025, more than twice that of 2024 in the final year of President Joe Biden’s administration. </p><p>The figure is an all-time record, and follows on President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> day one executive order on foreign vetting. In 2024, the department revoked 40,000 visas. </p><p>The majority of the revocations were for business and tourist travelers who overstayed their visas. </p><p>But some 8,000 students and 2,500 specialized workers also lost their legal status. A department spokesperson said a majority of the students and workers who lost their visas had criminal encounters with law enforcement. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-state-department-orders-global-visa-crackdown-under-revived-public-charge-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP STATE DEPARTMENT ORDERS GLOBAL VISA CRACKDOWN UNDER REVIVED ‘PUBLIC CHARGE’ RULE</strong></a></p><p>Among specialized workers, half of the revocations were based on drunken driving arrests, 30% for assault, battery or confinement charges, and the remaining 20% were revoked for theft, child abuse, substance abuse and distribution, and fraud and embezzlement charges. </p><p>Nearly 500 students lost visas for drug possession and distribution and hundreds of foreign workers lost visas because they were believed to be abusing children, according to a department spokesperson<strong>. </strong></p><p>In August 2025, the Trump administration announced it was reviewing all 55 million foreigners who have valid U.S. visas. </p><p>State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Piggott added that the administration would continue its aggressive enforcement posture through its new "continuous vetting center." </p><p>"The Trump administration will continue to put America first and protect our nation from foreign nationals who pose a risk to public safety or national security," he said. </p><p>The department also has enforced stricter standards for obtaining U.S. visas. </p><p>In November 2025, Fox News Digital first reported the department would enforce a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-state-department-orders-global-visa-crackdown-under-revived-public-charge-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"public charge" rule,</a> denying visas to applicants deemed likely to rely on public benefits. That included health reasons — putting older and overweight people under greater scrutiny — English competency, finances or other potential needs for long-term care. </p>
