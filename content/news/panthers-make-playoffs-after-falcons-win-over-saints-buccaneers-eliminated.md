<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carolina Panthers</a> fans don’t often root for their division rivals, but Sunday was an exception.</p><p>The final spot in the NFC playoffs came down to a matchup between two division rivals who had long been eliminated from postseason contention because the Tampa Bay Buccaneers <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfc-south-determined-game-between-saints-falcons-after-bucs-keep-season-alive-vs-panthers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept their playoff hopes alive</a> on Saturday with a 16-14 victory over the Panthers. Carolina would have clinched the division with a win, but following their loss, neither team controlled its own destiny anymore.</p><p>Instead, both of their playoff fates came down to Sunday’s matchup between the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons – Tampa Bay needed the Saints to win or tie, while the Panthers were Falcons fans for the day.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>It will likely be a while until Panthers fans root for the Falcons again, but they sure owe Atlanta a ton after the Falcons beat the Saints to give Carolina the NFC South title and simultaneously knock out the Bucs.</p><p>The Falcons got on the board first, just two plays after blocking a Saints punt and recovering it at New Orleans’ 5-yard line. An offensive holding penalty pushed them back 10 yards, but <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kirk-cousins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirk Cousins</a> found Drake London for a 15-yard score. After the Saints missed a field goal on their next drive, Atlanta found the uprights to go up 10-0.</p><p>The Saints answered with a 10-play drive that ended with Tyler Shough rushing for a score, cutting the lead to three points before the end of the first half. Atlanta kicked a field goal on its first drive of the second half to go up six, and the Saints were forced to settle for three after a touchdown was taken back because of a penalty. The Falcons kicked another to go up six with 10:43 to go.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/looking-back-sports-gambling-controversies-throughout-2025-nba-mlb-investigations-leading-way"><strong>LOOKING BACK AT THE SPORTS GAMBLING CONTROVERSIES THROUGHOUT 2025, WITH NBA AND MLB INVESTIGATIONS LEADING WAY</strong></a></p><p>With just over three minutes to go, the Saints got to the red zone, but Shough threw a costly interception that was returned to the New Orleans 27-yard line. Atlanta kicked yet another field goal, but this one made it a two-possession game.</p><p>The Saints scored a touchdown with 1:11 to go and lined up for the onside kick, but Atlanta recovered, giving Carolina the division.</p><p>It is the Panthers’ first playoff appearance since 2017. It is the fourth time an NFL team has won the division with a record below .500, a feat also accomplished by the Panthers in 2014, when they went 7-8-1.</p><p>As for the Bucs, it's the first time since the 2019 season—right before <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Brady</a> came to town—in which they will not play playoff football. Brady's first year, when they won a Super Bowl, snapped a 12-year playoff drought and started a streak of five consecutive playoff seasons, which is now over.</p><p>The Panthers are now locked into the No. 4 seed and will host a playoff game this weekend against either the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco 49ers</a> or Los Angeles Rams.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
