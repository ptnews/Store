<p>A bill introduced in Florida takes aim at paper drinking straws and stirrers at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">food businesses and restaurants.</a> </p><p>Senate Bill 958 was introduced Dec. 18 — with an identical House bill, HB 2195, introduced Dec. 26 — to limit what cities and counties can do to regulate drinking straws and stirrers.</p><p>"Many businesses and communities in this state are using paper drinking straws and stirrers as a purportedly better option for public health and the environment," HB 2195 states. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/restaurants-may-banned-handing-out-ketchup-packets-napkins-under-delaware-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RESTAURANTS MAY BE BANNED FROM HANDING OUT KETCHUP PACKETS, NAPKINS UNDER DELAWARE BILL</strong></a></p><p>"However, independent university studies have shown that most paper straws contain harmful PFAS chemicals, exposure to which is linked to concerning health risks."</p><p>The bill states that any <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulation of drinking straws</a> must be based on "government policy driven by science."</p><p>In a 2023 study published in the journal Food Additives and Contaminants, University of Antwerp researchers in Belgium found that 90% of paper straw brands tested contained PFAS chemicals. </p><p>Researchers found PFAS chemicals in 27 of 39 different straw variants, concluding the chemicals were most likely used as a water-repellent coating.</p><p>PFAS chemicals were most frequently detected in paper straws.</p><p>If local officials choose to regulate straws, the rules would require them to be renewable, home- and industrial-compostable certified and marine biodegradable.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>If passed, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the law would take effect</a> the day it is passed, with a deadline of Jan. 1, 2027, for local governments to update existing straw laws.</p><p>The rule does not apply to hospitals, medical centers or senior care facilities. It also does not apply to prepackaged drinks.</p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> took aim at paper straws in February, issuing an executive order banning the federal use of paper straws.</p><p>"Plastic straws are often replaced by paper straws, which are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human health</a>, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws and often force users to use multiple straws," the executive order says.</p><p>The order points out the switch is counterproductive because "paper straws sometimes come individually wrapped in plastic."</p><p>"I was tired of having straws melt in my mouth. You know, it wasn't working," Trump said in July.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</strong></a></p><p>"We solved so many commonsense problems, and they weren't easy. You know, there are people that really believe in this stuff."</p><p>In related news, a bill introduced in New Jersey would ban <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on-site restaurants</a> from providing single-use utensils to customers unless requested.</p><p>The bill was introduced in May and revised Dec. 18.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ </strong></a></p><p>Instead of plastic utensils, it would require restaurants to provide reusable, washable utensils for customers who are <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eating their meals</a> on site.</p><p>Restaurants would also not be allowed to provide condiments to on-site customers. </p><p>The bill states takeout customers may receive them if specifically requested.</p>
