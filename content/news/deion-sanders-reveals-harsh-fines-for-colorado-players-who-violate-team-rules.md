<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/colorado-buffaloes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deion Sanders</a> is not messing around.</p><p>The Colorado Buffaloes football coach instituted a fine policy <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for players</a> who violate team rules as he gets ready for the forthcoming 2026 season. Being late to practice will garner a $500 fine, while skipping it completely will come at a $2,500 cost.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Sanders announced the fines to the team last week. The structure was also spotted in a video posted by his son on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o81MUNmAXzE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Well Off Media</a> YouTube channel. The system wasn’t tied to the rise of name, image and likeness deals that have taken over college football and not related to on-field performance. It was strictly for violating team rules, which is permissible, according to Colorado.</p><p>One of the biggest rules had to do with team gear. Transfer players who wore T-shirts, sweatshirts or anything else from their former teams were strictly forbidden.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/qb-darian-mensah-joins-miami-hurricanes-after-legal-battle-with-duke" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DARIAN MENSAH OFFICIALLY JOINS MIAMI HURRICANES AFTER AGREEMENT WITH DUKE</strong></a></p><p>"That's disrespectful," Sanders said in the video. "That would be like your lady that you have currently wearing her (ex-boyfriend's) stuff. How do you feel about that? She's sitting up there with a shirt on that had her (ex-boyfriend's) name. ... That's how I feel about that when I see you come into the cafeteria — you eat our food with your last team on. Obviously, if you wanted to stay there, you should've stayed."</p><p>Other fines included $2,000 for being a no-show to a meeting or film and $400 for being late. A player will be fined $1,500 for not showing up to workouts and $1,000 for being late. A player may also be fined $2,500 for a violation of team rules and up to $5,000 for public or social media misconduct.</p><p>Sanders also bars profanity outside the meeting room and stressed the importance of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being respectful of women</a>.</p><p>Coach Prime’s fourth season with the Buffaloes will officially kick off on Sept. 5 on the road against Georgia Tech.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
