"I think that it's really pretty clear that you can't take private things and throw them out into the world like that without potential consequences. There can't possibly be a defense that her peace can't be disturbed because she had an OF page and did Playboy. That’s not a defense."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Phypers was also arrested in court on spousal abuse charges stemming from two separate incidents in 2017 and 2022, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.</p><p>Fox News Digital was in court when Phypers was handcuffed.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Tracy Wright contributed to this report.</i></p>
