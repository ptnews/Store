And it actually was about Newark right down the road here. And I got down to 128 … now I weigh probably 143, 144. I weighed 128," Thornton said.</p><p>That experience ultimately convinced him to stop putting his body through <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/matt-damon-says-he-dropped-high-school-weight-epic-transformation-the-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drastic fluctuations</a> for the sake of a role.</p><p>"So I stopped doing that.
