<p>ABC’s "World News Tonight" on Thursday failed to report that three anti-ICE agitators <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-agitator-arrested-wake-church-invasion-bondi-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were arrested</a> after a mob stormed a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota — instead focusing on the alleged detainment of a 5-year-old child by ICE in the same state.</p><p>ABC anchor David Muir opened the roughly two-and-a-half-minute segment on ICE by addressing the "growing outrage" over reports that a 5-year-old boy in Minnesota was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/white-house-dhs-push-back-claims-ice-targeted-5-year-old-minnesota-say-child-abandoned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detained by ICE</a> and used as "bait" to apprehend his father, an illegal immigrant.</p><p>While the segment focused almost entirely on the alleged detention of the Minnesota boy, it omitted another major ICE-related development from the same week — the arrests of several anti-ICE agitators who disrupted a church service.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/pastors-warn-chilling-effect-after-anti-ice-agitators-storm-minnesota-church-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PASTORS WARN OF 'CHILLING EFFECT' AFTER ANTI-ICE AGITATORS STORM MINNESOTA CHURCH SERVICE</strong></a></p><p>ABC's omission of the Minnesota church protest arrests was first noted by NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck, who <a href="https://x.com/curtishouck/status/2014546257964888425?s=12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">called out the network</a> on X Thursday for not featuring "a single word" concerning the arrests.</p><p>ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital.</a> </p><p>Other evening broadcasts, such as NBC's "Nightly News" and CBS' "Evening News," briefly covered the arrest of the St. Paul church agitators. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on Thursday that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/far-left-agitator-who-organized-minnesota-church-storming-raked-over-1-million-from-nonprofit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nekima Levy Armstrong,</a> Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly were arrested in connection with the protest.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-says-ice-agents-rammed-vehicles-amid-minneapolis-enforcement-surge-aggressively-assaulted" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DHS SAYS ICE AGENTS RAMMED BY VEHICLES AMID MINNEAPOLIS ENFORCEMENT SURGE: 'AGGRESSIVELY ASSAULTED'</strong></a></p><p>Despite widespread reports that the Minnesota child was "detained" by federal immigration officers, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rejected that characterization.</p><p>According to DHS, the 5-year-old child was not detained by ICE, but rather, was "abandoned" during an immigration enforcement operation. </p><p>After Democrats — including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. — shared an image of a 5-year-old boy online and claimed he was arrested by ICE while coming home from pre-school, the White House fired back in a statement to Fox News Digital. </p><p>White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson condemned what the Trump administration views as the mainstream media working "hand-in-glove with Democrats to spread malicious lies about ICE operations." </p><p>"It’s shameful that the media so quickly runs with the fake Democrat narrative without first getting the facts," Jackson said. "Here’s the reality: ICE officers work heroically with the utmost professionalism to make American communities safer. In this instance, they stayed with a child who was abandoned by his father — an illegal alien from Ecuador."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-pastor-condemns-anti-ice-agitators-interrupted-service-shameful-unlawful" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA PASTOR CONDEMNS ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO INTERRUPTED SERVICE: ‘SHAMEFUL AND UNLAWFUL’</strong></a></p><p>On ABC News' website, the outlet published <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/5-year-asylum-seeker-detained-ice-expands-enforcement/story?id=129451987" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an article</a> titled "5-year-old asylum seeker detained as ICE expands enforcement in Minnesota," framing the headline in a way which states the boy was "detained" as fact, despite DHS disputing this claim.</p><p>Although the outlet later included DHS’s statement — "ICE did NOT target a child. The child was ABANDONED." — that clarification was buried below the fold rather than in the headline.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/DrewHolden360/status/2014453382858068444?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">As noted</a> by American Compass managing editor Drew Holden on X, the Daily Beast published a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ice-detains-5-year-old-child-after-school/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">similar headline</a>: "ICE Detains 5-Year-Old Child After School," also presenting the claim as fact.</p>
