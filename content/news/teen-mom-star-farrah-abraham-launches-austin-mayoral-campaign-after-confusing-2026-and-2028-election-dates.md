Why so early?" the hosts asked.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/farrah-abraham-arrested-slapping-security-guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FARRAH ABRAHAM ARRESTED FOR SLAPPING A SECURITY GUARD AT A NIGHTCLUB IN HOLLYWOOD</u></strong></a></p><p>Abraham responded confidently — and incorrectly. "For some reason, the mayor election is in 2026…" she said.</p><p>During the live interview, TMZ called City Hall in Austin, and Abraham had a stunned reaction. "So, Farrah, we just got this in our ear, the election is in 2028… so I think you may have jumped the gun here."</p><p>The revelation appeared to catch Abraham completely off guard. She visibly struggled as the hosts explained the difference between municipal, district and federal election cycles.</p><p>"I love that I jumped the gun," she replied with a smile, embracing the confused moment.</p><p>Austin Mayor Kirk Watson was elected in 2024 and is serving a four-year term. The next mayoral race won’t take place until 2028.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News Digital, Abraham shared that she's dialing back her political ambitions, abandoning a bid for Austin, Texas, mayor and jumping into a City Council race instead. </p><p>"So I'm not running for mayor ... It's local district five, which I think is great. I had no idea that I was going to be switching and amending so quickly. But I'm happy that the city was open to it. And I'm very excited," Abraham said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/michael-rapaport-eyes-2029-nyc-mayoral-run-after-slamming-mayor-zoron-moron" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MICHAEL RAPAPORT EYES 2029 NYC MAYORAL RUN AFTER SLAMMING MAYOR AS ‘ZORON THE MORON’</strong></a></p><p>A rep for the former MTV star also shared a statement with Fox News Digital detailing her decision to run for office.</p><p>"I’m running for Austin City Council District 5 because our city has lost balance — we’ve gone soft on crime, driven up prices and left working families like mine struggling to keep up. Enough is enough," Abraham, 34, shared.</p><p>"I’ve faced Hollywood drama, cancel culture and online trolls and I’m still here — ready to fight for Austin families who don’t have lobbyists or insider access. I’m here for the everyday parents juggling jobs, school runs and dreams. It’s time for a survivor mom who knows how to hustle and make real change."</p><p>She additionally laid out a six-point platform she said will anchor her election run.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
