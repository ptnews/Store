<p>OpenAI is rolling out <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT Health</a>, a new space for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private health and wellness conversations</a>. Importantly, the company says it will not use your health information or Health chats to train its core artificial intelligence (AI) models. As more people turn to ChatGPT to understand lab results and prepare for doctor visits, that promise matters. For many users, privacy remains the deciding factor.</p><p>Meanwhile, Health appears as a separate space inside ChatGPT for early-access users. You will see it in the sidebar on desktop and in the menu on mobile. If you ask a health-related question in a regular chat, ChatGPT may suggest moving the conversation into Health for added protection. For now, access remains limited. However, OpenAI says it plans to roll out ChatGPT Health gradually to users on Free, Go, Plus and Pro plans.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong></p><p>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

Here is what stands out:</p><p>Health conversations live in their own area. Files, chats and memories stay contained there. They do not mix with your regular ChatGPT conversations.</p><p>ChatGPT Health is not meant to diagnose conditions or replace a doctor. You will see reminders that responses are informational only and not medical advice.</p><p>If you choose, you can connect medical records and wellness apps to Health. This helps ground responses in your own data. Supported connections include:</p><p>You control access. You can disconnect any app at any time and revoke permissions immediately.</p><p>OpenAI says Health uses additional encryption and isolation designed specifically for sensitive health data. Health chats are excluded from training foundation models by default.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/can-ai-chatbots-trigger-psychosis-vulnerable-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CAN AI CHATBOTS TRIGGER PSYCHOSIS IN VULNERABLE PEOPLE?</strong></a></p><p>Even with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stronger privacy</a> promises, caution still matters. Avoid sharing:</p><p>Health is designed to inform and prepare you, not to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replace professional care</a> or secure systems built for identity protection.</p><p>OpenAI built ChatGPT Health with direct input from more than 260 physicians across many medical specialties worldwide. Over two years, those clinicians reviewed hundreds of thousands of example responses and flagged wording that could confuse readers or delay care.</p><p>As a result, their feedback guides how ChatGPT Health explains lab results, frames risk, and prompts follow-ups with a licensed clinician. More importantly, the system focuses on safety, clarity, and timely escalation when needed. Ultimately, the goal is to help you have better conversations with your doctor, not replace one.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/openai-limits-chatgpts-role-mental-health-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OPENAI LIMITS CHATGPT’S ROLE IN MENTAL HEALTH HELP</strong></a></p><p>For many people, health information is scattered across portals, PDFs, apps and emails. ChatGPT Health aims to pull that context together in one place.</p><p>That can help you:</p><p>The key takeaway is control. You decide what to connect, what to delete and when to walk away.</p><p>If you do not see Health yet, you can join the waitlist inside ChatGPT. Once you have access:</p><p>You can also customize instructions inside Health to control tone, topics, and focus.</p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?

What matters most is the privacy line OpenAI is drawing. Health conversations stay separate and are not used to train core models. That promise builds trust, but smart sharing still matters. AI can help you prepare, understand and organize. Your doctor still makes the call.</p><p>Would you trust an AI assistant with your health data if it promised stronger privacy than standard chat tools, or does that still feel like a step too far?  Let us know by writing to us at <i><strong>Cyberguy.com.</strong></i></p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong></p><p>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.
