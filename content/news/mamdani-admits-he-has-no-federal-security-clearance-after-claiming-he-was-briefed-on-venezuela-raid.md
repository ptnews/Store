<p>New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/zohran-mamdani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a> admitted he has no federal security clearance on Monday, just a day after claiming he had been "briefed" about the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Mamdani was asked directly about his security clearance during a Monday press briefing, ultimately saying that he had not yet received it. The freshly-inaugurated mayor had been the butt of viral jokes on social media from users suggesting he had inflated his access to information about the strike in his initial statement.</p><p>"You don't have federal security clearance yet, and has anyone from a federal agency reached out to you or members of your team to begin the vetting to get federal security clearance?" a reporter asked.</p><p>"That briefing, yes, was conducted by my team," Mamdani responded. "And the question of federal security clearance is one that's on and on."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-military-details-timeline-operation-capture-maduro-revealing-more-than-150-aircraft-involved" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US MILITARY DETAILS TIMELINE OF OPERATION TO CAPTURE MADURO, REVEALING MORE THAN 150 AIRCRAFT INVOLVED</strong></a></p><p>"So you do have it?" the reporter pressed.</p><p>"No, not as yet," the mayor admitted.</p><p>The exchange came after Mamdani's initial statement on the Venezuela raid appeared to suggest he had received inside information on the operation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jonathan-turley-maduro-operation-legal-trump-makes-complicated" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JONATHAN TURLEY: MADURO OPERATION WAS LEGAL, BUT TRUMP MAKES IT COMPLICATED</strong></a></p><p>"I was briefed this morning on the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-mayor-strongly-condemns-trumps-capture-venezuelan-leader-maduro-act-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. military capture of Venezuelan President</a> Nicolás Maduro and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City," Mamdani wrote on X after news of Maduro's capture broke.</p><p>He went on to condemn the move by President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>, but some users on social media called him out for inflating his access.</p><p>"Called it," wrote one user whose post on the topic received over 140,000 "likes."</p><p>Mamdani's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.</p>
