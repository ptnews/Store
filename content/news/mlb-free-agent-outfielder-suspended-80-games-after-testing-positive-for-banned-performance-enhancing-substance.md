<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Major League Baseball</a> announced Friday that free agent outfielder Max Kepler received an 80-game suspension following a positive test for a banned performance-enhancing substance.</p><p>Kepler, 32, tested positive for epitrenbolone, which is a metabolite of trenbolone. The substance is found in some products sold at bodybuilding stores and has been used to promote cattle growth.</p><p>Kepler spent the first 10 seasons of his career with the Minnesota Twins after signing there as a 16-year-old in 2009. Last season, he signed a one-year, $10 million contract with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/philadelphia-phillies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philadelphia Phillies</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>He struggled last season, hitting .216 with 18 home runs and 52 RBIs in 127 games. In Kepler’s 11-year career, he has a .225 batting average with 179 home runs and 560 RBIs.</p><p>The Germany native is the first player suspended for the substance since the public announcement of penalty details began in 2005.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mlb-commissioner-rob-manfred-teases-major-moves-he-wants-accomplish-before-retirement-he-eyes-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MLB COMMISSIONER ROB MANFRED TEASES MAJOR MOVES HE WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE RETIREMENT AS HE EYES EXPANSION</strong></a></p><p>Kepler accepted the suspension without contesting the discipline through a grievance.</p><p>Epitrenbolone was the substance that led to a suspension in 2018 for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/boxing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boxer Manuel Charr</a>. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced the following year that a positive test for the substance prompted it to disqualify 90-year-old cyclist Carl Grove from a world record he had set at the 2018 Masters Track National Championship. </p><p>Fourteen players were suspended last year for positive tests, including two under the major league program. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/atlanta-braves" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta Braves</a> outfielder Jurickson Profar was suspended 80 games March 31, and Phillies closer José Alvarado was suspended 80 games May 25.</p><p>Even if Kepler does not have a contract by opening day in March, MLB and the union usually allow a suspended free agent to serve his penalty as long as he is attempting to reach a deal with teams.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
