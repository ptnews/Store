"There’s no f---ing humility. How about some humility? I don’t care what party you’re with. I don’t give a f---. But show some humility and some respect for each other, which they just don’t. They just don’t, it’s terrible."</p><p>He said that his grandmother, who lived to be 100 years old, reminded him to appreciate life because it is all too short.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/teddi-mellencamp-struggles-speech-cancer-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEDDI MELLENCAMP STRUGGLES WITH SPEECH FOLLOWING CANCER TREATMENT</strong></a></p><p>He said when she was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-traditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 99 years old</a> she told him: "You know, John, if you don’t stop this cussing and wild living, you’re not going to get into Heaven."</p><p>He said he dismissed the idea to her, but she insisted: "'You need to change your ways a little bit,’ and I said, ‘Yeah, well, you’ll get me into Heaven, don’t worry about it.’ And she said, ‘No.’ She said, ‘You’re going to find out real soon.

It’s like what do you want to go to work for? You know, my son [Hud Mellencamp] graduated from Duke, and it’s like, ‘Eh, f--- that work. Do what you want to do. You’re 31 years old. You’re handsome, you’re 31 years old. You could beat up anybody in the room.' … But I think he’s getting to the age where he wants to get a job, and I don’t want him to leave because he still lives on my property, and it’s nice. I love having him live there. I love having him with me."</p><p>He said his son lives on his property in another house, but if he calls him, Hud will be right over.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
