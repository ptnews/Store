<p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/louisiana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Louisiana woman’s</a> attempt to go for a skinny-dip did not end swimmingly, authorities said, after she allegedly attacked a sheriff’s deputy responding to a trespassing complaint before finally surrendering to deputies Tuesday.</p><p>According to the Union Parish Sheriff’s Office, deputies were dispatched in November to a residence in the Linville community of Marion after a caller reported a neighbor standing in their driveway screaming and refusing to leave the property despite having been warned previously.</p><p>When a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patrol deputy</a> arrived, authorities said the suspect was found nude and swimming in a pond located on the caller’s property. </p><p>The woman was later identified as Erin Elizabeth Sutton, 41, of Marion. Sutton initially refused to exit the pond or speak with the deputy, telling him she was "trying to be a mermaid," according to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1GBM19RFaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sheriff’s office Facebook post</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/wild-video-shows-speeding-car-going-airborne-ejects-driver-backyard-pool" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WILD VIDEO SHOWS SPEEDING CAR GOING AIRBORNE, EJECTS DRIVER INTO BACKYARD POOL</strong></a></p><p>After repeated commands, Sutton eventually exited the pond. Due to cold temperatures, emergency medical services were contacted to evaluate her, authorities said. </p><p>A blanket was provided, and as the deputy attempted to escort Sutton inside a residence to warm up, she allegedly charged at him.</p><p>Authorities said Sutton ignored multiple commands to comply and resisted detention. A taser was deployed but had no effect, according to the sheriff’s office. Sutton was taken to the ground, where she allegedly continued to resist, kicking and punching the deputy before being restrained.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-bites-ice-officer-gross-attack-while-resisting-arrest-dhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT BITES ICE OFFICER IN 'GROSS ATTACK' WHILE RESISTING ARREST: DHS</strong></a></p><p>Sutton was transported to a hospital for further treatment. During the transport, she allegedly threatened to kill deputies and paramedics, authorities said.</p><p>Because Sutton required medical care at the time, deputies later sought arrest warrants, which were signed by a judge in Louisiana’s Third Judicial District Court, according to the sheriff’s office.</p><p>Sutton surrendered to deputies on Jan. 6, 2025, and was arrested on multiple charges, including three counts of resisting an officer with force or violence, two counts of public intimidation, two counts of battery of a police officer, disturbing the peace/drunkenness and criminal trespassing.</p><p>Her bond was set at $62,000, authorities said.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the Union Parish Sheriff’s Office for additional comment but did not immediately receive a response.
