<p>Trump administration "border czar" <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-homan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Homan,</a> pushed back on MS NOW host Jen Psaki after she suggested he should be held "accountable" by Congress.</p><p>Psaki made the remarks during a segment with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., when she asked whether Democrats are keeping a list of officials they would investigate if they regain control of the House. Among the names she raised were Homan and Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino.</p><p>"Is holding them to account at the top of your priority list?" Psaki asked on "The Briefing with Jen Psaki" Friday.</p><p>Khanna responded, "absolutely," noting House Democrats would make <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/investigations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigating figures like Bovino and Homan</a> a top priority.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republican-calls-hearing-after-deadly-ice-shooting-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOUSE REPUBLICAN CALLS FOR HEARING AFTER DEADLY ICE SHOOTING IN MINNEAPOLIS</strong></a></p><p>"Come get some," Homan replied on "Saturday in America."</p><p>Homan has repeatedly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called on lawmakers</a> to tone down anti-ICE rhetoric, arguing it has made enforcement more dangerous for officers. He pushed back directly on Psaki and Khanna.</p><p>"We’re just enforcing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laws that Congress enacted</a>. And for a member of Congress to say, ‘We are going to investigate officers for enforcing laws that we wrote,’ that’s just ridiculous," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-slams-dems-complaining-about-immigration-law-it-quite-literally-job-change-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DHS SLAMS DEMS FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT IMMIGRATION LAW: 'IT IS QUITE LITERALLY THEIR JOB TO CHANGE IT'</strong></a></p><p>Several Democratic leaders have been outspoken critics of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies, with some calling for ICE to be dismantled entirely. A bill to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-dilemma-progressive-push-abolish-ice-sparks-fresh-divide-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced this week</a> in Congress.</p><p>Homan warned hostile political rhetoric is making violence against officers worse and singled out Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a>.</p><p>"Rhetoric from the mayor and the governor emboldens that small percentage who go beyond protesting to criminal activity," he said.</p><p>Both Frey and Walz have called for immigration enforcement efforts to be suspended in Minnesota. The calls followed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-agent-shoots-venezuelan-national-minneapolis-shovel-attack-ambush-dhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the shooting death</a> of Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good by a federal immigration agent earlier this month, sparking weeks of protests across the city.</p><p>"They feel empowered to interfere, impede <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE officers</a>, put their hands on ICE officers, throw weapons, throw stones and frozen water bottles at ICE officers. I begged the politicians to stop with hateful rhetoric," Homan said of the demonstrations.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/08/radical-rhetoric-sanctuary-politicians-leads-unprecedented-1300-increase-assaults" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Department of Homeland Security</a> reported on Jan. 8 that ICE officers have faced a more than 1,300% increase in reported assaults, a 3,200% rise in vehicular attacks and an 8,000% spike in death threats.</p>
