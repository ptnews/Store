<p>As President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> escalates his efforts to acquire Greenland from Denmark, the latest national polls reveal that most Americans oppose taking over the massive and crucially strategic island that lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.</p><p>Trump is holding <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-head-davos-greenland-dispute-sparks-rising-tensions-nato-allies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crucial talks Wednesday on Greenland</a> with NATO allies during a quick stop in Davos, Switzerland.</p><p>On the eve of his trip, the president said there is "no going back" on his efforts to take over Greenland. Asked at a White House news conference how far he'd go to acquire the semi-autonomous Danish territory, Trump said: "You'll find out." The president has also threatened tariffs against NATO members.</p><p>In his speech at Davos, the president said: "I'm seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States." But Trump added, "I don't want to use force."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-trump-zeroed-greenland-why-matters-3-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHY TRUMP ZEROED IN ON GREENLAND AND WHY IT MATTERS IN 3 MAPS</strong></a></p><p>But Trump's moves are facing opposition from Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill, and the most recent surveys suggest there's little appetite among Americans to take over the island.</p><p>Eighty-six percent of voters nationwide questioned in a Quinnipiac University poll released last week said they would oppose military action to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>take over Greenland</u></a>.</p><p>That includes 95% of Democrats, 94% of Independents and even more than two-thirds (68%) of Republicans <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3945" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">surveyed by Quinnipiac</a> Jan. 8-12.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/denmark-trumps-crosshairs-us-makes-ambitious-appeal-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>DENMARK IN TRUMP'S CROSSHAIRS AS US MAKES AMBITIOUS APPEAL TO GREENLAND</u></strong></a></p><p>Three-quarters of Americans questioned in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/15/politics/greenland-cnn-poll" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>CNN poll</u></a> conducted at the same time said they opposed a U.S. takeover of Greenland.
