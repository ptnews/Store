<p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia</a> school board has changed its policies to stop employees from forcing other teachers and students to address them by pronouns that differ from their biological sex.</p><p>At its Dec. 15 meeting, the Chesapeake School Board voted 7-2 to amend its policy on professional conduct to ban the compelled speech of employees regarding personal titles or pronouns.</p><p>The updated policy, as reported Thursday by <a href="https://www.christianpost.com/news/virginia-school-board-bans-compelled-use-of-trans-pronouns.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Christian Post</a>, now says that all employees are expected to refrain from compelling other staff or students from addressing any employee or referring to any employee in a way that violates the staff member (or student)'s constitutionally protected rights.</p><p>Employees are also instructed to "refrain from providing a student his or her preferred personal title or pronouns if such preferred personal title or pronouns do not correspond to his or her sex."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/virginia-parents-face-125k-bond-payment-continue-controversial-transgender-locker-room-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VIRGINIA PARENTS FACE $125K BOND PAYMENT TO CONTINUE CONTROVERSIAL TRANSGENDER LOCKER ROOM CASE</strong></a></p><p>The decision was reached after nearly an hour of public comment, with several pro-LGBTQ speakers voicing their opposition to the measure.</p><p>Angela Swygert, the chair of the Chesapeake Public Schools Board of Education, told critics she supported the measure, arguing that the use of alternative pronouns and titles is a "controversial and complex issue" that is best handled by families and does not "belong in the classroom."</p><p>The changes are meant to foster mutual respect, she explained.</p><p>"A person who does not fundamentally agree with the use of alternative pronouns and titles cannot be compelled to use them," Swygert said at the meeting.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/youngkin-orders-protection-womens-rooms-loudoun-schools-ask-students-promote-coming-out-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>YOUNGKIN ORDERS PROTECTION OF WOMEN’S ROOMS AS LOUDOUN SCHOOLS ASK STUDENTS TO PROMOTE ‘COMING OUT DAY'</strong></a></p><p>The policy change is focused on district staff and employee activity and does not stop employees from voluntarily using alternative pronouns among peers.</p><p>"These revisions do not in any way govern how these issues are addressed for our students," <a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/chesapeake/chesapeake-school-board-to-vote-on-pronoun-policy-for-teachers-and-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">she added</a> at the meeting. "Our policy has been and will remain that we navigate this issue with students on a case-by-case basis, in full and transparent communication and partnership with their parents."</p><p>The measure's approval drew a harsh rebuke from the editorial board of the local paper, The Virginia-Pilot, which declared that the updated pronoun policy would effectively "ban transgender people from working as teachers and staff" in the district.</p><p>"In succumbing to trans panic and promoting discrimination against a marginalized group, members of the School Board have made a decision that will reflect poorly on all that the city hopes to achieve," the paper's <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/12/29/editorial-chesapeake-school-officials-shamefully-embrace-anti-trans-panic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">editorial board wrote</a>.
