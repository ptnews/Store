<p>A preliminary ballistic match linking a gun recovered from Michael McKee’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/illinois" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Illinois property</a> to the scene of a double homicide of an Ohio dentist and his wife marks a "big problem for him and his defense team," according to legal experts.</p><p>McKee, 39, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/surgeon-ohio-dentist-double-murder-allegedly-used-fake-addresses-dodge-lawsuits-he-just-disappeared" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Chicago-area vascular surgeon,</a> faces two counts of premeditated aggravated murder in the Dec. 30 shooting deaths of his ex-wife, Monique Tepe, 39, and her husband, Spencer Tepe, 37.</p><p>Columbus Division of Police Chief Elaine Bryant confirmed that multiple firearms were seized from McKee’s Rockford, Illinois, property and that a preliminary analysis through the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) linked one of those weapons to three 9mm shell casings recovered from the Tepe residence.</p><p>"It's absolutely going to look like a big problem for him and his defense team. As a defense attorney, you want to explore as many avenues as you can in terms of defense," said R.J.

The defense might start to focus on whether McKee ever had any mental health issues."</p><p>Dreiling said the forensic link is significant because it resolves one of the two central questions in any murder case: who committed the crime.</p><p>"Once you have casings at the scene that match a gun in the suspect’s possession, that’s going to present some significant issues to the defense," he said.</p><p>Investigators have also outlined a timeline of the suspect's movements surrounding the killings, saying that they have linked the surgeon with surveillance video.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxTrueCrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/critical-clue-led-police-suspect-chicago-doctor-deaths-ohio-dentist-wife" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surveillance video captured a person</a> believed to be McKee walking through an alley near the victims’ home between approximately 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on the morning of the shootings.</p><p>License plate reader data and surveillance technology tracked McKee’s vehicle traveling roughly 325 miles from Illinois to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Columbus, arriving</a> shortly before the killings and departing soon afterward, police said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/family-quickly-believed-surgeon-ex-was-involved-ohio-dentist-couples-murder-co-worker-details-mishaps"><strong><u>FAMILY ‘QUICKLY BELIEVED’ SURGEON EX WAS INVOLVED IN OHIO DENTIST COUPLE'S MURDER AS CO-WORKER DETAILS MISHAPS</u></strong></a></p><p>Authorities also reported no signs of forced entry at the North Fourth Street residence.
