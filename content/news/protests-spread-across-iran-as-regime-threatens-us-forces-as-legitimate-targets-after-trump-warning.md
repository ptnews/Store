It comes as protests entered a sixth day and appear to be spreading, with Iranian opposition groups claiming at least eight deaths.</p><p>"The disrespectful President of America should also know that with this official admission, all American centers and forces across the entire region will be legitimate targets for us in response to any potential adventurism," Qalibaf wrote in Persian on X.</p><p>"Iranians have always been united and determined to act in the face of an aggressor enemy," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-protesters-clash-security-forces-tear-gas-fills-tehran-streets-amid-nationwide-unrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRANIAN PROTESTERS CLASH WITH SECURITY FORCES AS TEAR GAS FILLS TEHRAN STREETS AMID NATIONWIDE UNREST</strong></a></p><p>Qalibaf’s threat emerges as the United States maintains a substantial military presence in the region.</p><p>Roughly 40,000 active-duty U.S. troops and War Department civilians are deployed across the Middle East, according to <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/06/18/us-troops-bases-in-middle-east-could-be-targets-in-conflict-with-iran/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Military Times</a>, citing Pentagon officials.

The group said the youngest victim was 15 years old. The claims could not be independently verified.</p><p>According to the NCRI, demonstrations and street fighting intensified overnight, with protesters blocking roads, throwing stones and setting fire to police vehicles in multiple cities, including Marvdasht, Semirom, Darreh-Shahr, Ramhormoz and Azna. </p><p>The group also claimed demonstrators burned a statue of slain Iranian Gen.

"Therefore, from here, I say to the clerics, the Revolutionary Guards, the Basij forces, and their intelligence agents: whatever measures you take, you will not be able to silence a people who have resolved to overthrow the clerical regime."</p><p>"You may kill, you may wound, you may arrest and imprison, but you will not escape the relentless wrath of this nation. And let this stand as an explicit warning to all those who order and carry out these crimes and killings: the courts of a free Iran are awaiting you."</p><p>Meanwhile, exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the eldest son of Iran’s former shah, praised Trump’s "decisive leadership" and tough stance against Iran’s ruling clerics.</p><p>Pahlavi said Iranians are risking their lives to end 46 years of rule by the Islamic Republic.</p><p>"[The people] have entrusted me with a message along with a great responsibility: to strive for the revival of the relationship that Iran once had with America; a relationship that brought peace and prosperity to the Middle East," Pahlavi wrote on X.</p><p>"I have a clear plan for a stable transition in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran</a> and enjoy the support of my people to achieve it. With your leadership in the free world, we can leave behind a lasting legacy of enduring peace."</p><p><i>Fox News’ Bradford Betz, Greg Norman, Morgan Phillips and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
