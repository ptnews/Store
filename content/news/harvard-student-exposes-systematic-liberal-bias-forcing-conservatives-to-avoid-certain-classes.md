<p>A student at Harvard said that "systematic" bias exists at the <a href="https://https://www.foxnews.com/us/harvard-dean-removed-after-anti-white-anti-police-social-media-posts-resurfaced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivy League institution</a> after university president Alan Garber admitted the school "went wrong" by letting faculty push personal political and ideological viewpoints on students in the classroom. </p><p>Tejas Billa, a <a href="https://https://www.foxnews.com/us/harvard-president-criticizes-faculty-activism-claims-university-bringing-objectivity-back-classroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sophomore at Harvard</a>, described the climate at one of the country’s top-ranked schools and how some students feel "not welcome" in certain departments and classes in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital. </p><p>"I do absolutely think it's a systemic issue," Billa told Fox. "I'd say that President Garber's comments were really in line with what a lot of the reports and the investigations into them found, which is that there are a lot of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/curriculum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political biases."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOT A SCOOP ON CAMPUS? SEND US A TIP HERE</strong></a></p><p>Billa refers to comments that were made by Garber during the "Identity/Crisis Podcast" in mid-December. During the show, Garber addressed concerns about activism in the classroom being driven by faculty.</p><p>Garber also acknowledged how <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/campus-radicals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professors or faculty members</a> who push their ideals on students can make those students feel cornered or isolated.</p><p>"If a professor in a classroom says, this is what I believe about this issue, how many students — some of you probably would be prepared to deal with this, but most people wouldn’t — how many students would actually be willing to go toe to toe against a professor who’s expressed a firm view about a controversial issue?" Garber questioned. </p><p>Billa confirmed Garber’s explanation that conservatives will intentionally avoid taking certain courses, especially social science, because they know they won’t feel comfortable or have the opportunity to voice their opinions.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SIGN UP TO GET CAMPUS RADICALS NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>The Harvard student noted that those courses typically have a "political bias towards, generally, the left."</p><p>"There's been a lot of pretty well documented instances of professors rescheduling classes to allow students to attend a left-wing protest," Billa told Fox News Digital. "That was in the task force report and I think that absolutely has an effect on, you know, the students in the class and what they're willing to say in the class and at school more broadly."</p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> administration has been at odds with the Ivy League university since he took office over antisemitism concerns and the liberal bias that Billa and Garber describe.</p><p>In April of last year, the Trump administration sent a letter to Harvard outlining reforms the school should make regarding DEI, antisemitism, hiring and admissions practices.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/campus-radicals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE CAMPUS RADICALS COAST TO COAST</strong></a></p><p>Harvard rejected the demands, leading to a $2.2 billion <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal funding freeze</a> last April that lasted until September when an Obama-appointed Massachusetts judge ruled the freeze unconstitutional. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-appeals-ruling-restoring-2-7b-federal-funding-harvard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration filed for appeal</a>, which was granted, and set the stage for a continued legal battle into 2026.</p><p>When asked about whether the legal battle was a distraction for Harvard, Billa said it’s impacting students "a whole ton," but is a result of uncovered bias that has been kept off the radar. </p><p>"I also think that there were a lot of these sorts of instances of political bias, of antisemitism that just kept building until they really reached a breaking point in the last couple of years," Billa told Fox News Digital. "People realized how bad the situation has gotten and how it's actually impacting students a whole ton."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Harvard for comment.</p>
