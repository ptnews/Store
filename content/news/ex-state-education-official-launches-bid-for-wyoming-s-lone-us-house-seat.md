<p>Jillian Balow, a former Wyoming state superintendent of public instruction, is jumping into the congressional race to succeed Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/harriet-hageman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harriet Hageman</a> in the Cowboy State's at-large U.S. House district.</p><p>"Wyoming deserves a representative who understands our way of life and fights for it every day in Washington," Balow said, according to a press release obtained by Fox News Digital "I am running to defend Wyoming’s energy economy, protect our constitutional freedoms, support parents and students, and make sure the voices of rural communities are never ignored."</p><p>The race is an open contest as Hageman announced a U.S. Senate bid last month after GOP Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-sen-cynthia-lummis-not-seek-re-election-2026-citing-energy-required" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cynthia Lummis announced</a> that she would not seek re-election.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scoop-trump-ally-harriet-hageman-who-ousted-cheney-launches-senate-bid-keep-gop-seat-republican-hands" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SCOOP: TRUMP ALLY WHO OUSTED CHENEY LAUNCHES SENATE BID TO KEEP GOP SEAT IN REPUBLICAN HANDS</strong></a></p><p>"I am proud of the legacy Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congresswoman Harriet Hageman have built by standing up for Wyoming values and refusing to back down in Washington," Balow noted, according to the press release. "They are trailblazers for our state, and I am running to carry that same strong, independent Wyoming voice forward, to follow in their footsteps, and to fight for our state with the same conviction and resolve."</p><p>Balow will face competition in the GOP primary for the U.S. House seat from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/wyoming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wyoming</a> Secretary of State Chuck Gray and Reid Rasner, who lost a 2024 Republican U.S. Senate primary in the state to incumbent Sen.

"This campaign is about protecting what makes Wyoming strong and ensuring our state has a confident, independent voice in Congress."</p>
