<p>The Washington Post editorial board praised President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>'s military operation in Venezuela as an "unquestionable tactical success" <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/03/venezuela-trump-maduro-operation-machado-next/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in an editorial</a> Saturday.</p><p>"President Donald Trump’s decision to capture [Maduro] on Saturday is one of the boldest moves a president has made in years, and the operation was an unquestionable tactical success," the board wrote.</p><p>The editorial was titled "Justice in Venezuela." </p><p>"The next step is ensuring that this triumph sets Venezuela up for stability rather than chaos," the piece continued.</p><p>The editorial board noted the success proved America's military and intelligence capabilities remain "second to none," adding, "This is a major victory for American interests . . .</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-capture-maduro-championed-condemned-across-world-stage-after-surgical-venezuela-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US CAPTURE OF MADURO CHAMPIONED, CONDEMNED ACROSS WORLD STAGE AFTER SURGICAL VENEZUELA STRIKES</strong></a></p><p>"Maduro’s removal also sends an important message to tinpot dictators in Latin America and the world: Trump follows through," the board wrote. "President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> offered sanctions relief to Venezuela, and Maduro responded to that show of weakness by stealing an election."</p><p>The paper assessed, "Trump offered Maduro several off-ramps. He could have retired and lived a luxury lifestyle in Moscow or Minsk. Instead, he will probably die in prison. It’s an all-time miscalculation." </p><p>The editorial board discussed the potential outcomes that could arise from the leadership gap and the legal questions surrounding the president's actions without seeking congressional approval.</p><p>"There are also legitimate legal questions about the operation, though Maduro was viewed as a criminal by both Trump and Biden, who raised the reward to $25 million for information leading to his arrest," the board wrote.</p><p>"Sen. Mike Lee said Secretary of State Marco Rubio called him Saturday to say that Trump had the right to act as commander-in-chief. No doubt this debate will continue, and it’s good for democratic hygiene to scrutinize the decision."</p><p>By contrast, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/opinion/venezuela-attack-trump-us.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The New York Times editorial board</a> criticized the operation as "illegal and unwise" in a Saturday piece.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/from-bus-driver-dictator-nicolas-maduros-rise-fall-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FROM BUS DRIVER TO DICTATOR: NICOLÁS MADURO’S RISE AND FALL IN VENEZUELA</strong></a></p><p>"Mr. Trump has not yet offered a coherent explanation for his actions in Venezuela. He is pushing our country toward an international crisis without valid reasons," the outlet wrote.</p><p>"If Mr. Trump wants to argue otherwise, the Constitution spells out what he must do: Go to Congress. Without congressional approval, his actions violate U.S. law."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The White House</a> did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p><p>U.S. military forces launched a large-scale military operation in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/latin-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caracas, Venezuela</a>, early Saturday, with special forces seizing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in the process.</p><p>There is a pending 2020 indictment of Maduro in the Southern District of New York, where he is expected to be taken to face prosecution.</p><p>The move largely drew backing from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican lawmakers</a> but scrutiny from Democrats.</p><p><i>Fox News' Jonathan Turley contributed to this report.</i></p>
