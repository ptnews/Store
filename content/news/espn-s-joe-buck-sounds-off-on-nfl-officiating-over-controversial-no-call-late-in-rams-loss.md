<p>ESPN broadcaster Joe Buck sounded off on the referees for missing a critical penalty late in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/atlanta-falcons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta Falcons'</a> 27-24 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Monday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.</p><p>The Falcons kicked the go-ahead field goal late in the fourth quarter, giving the Rams the ball back with less than 30 seconds remaining and no timeouts. On second down, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/matthew-stafford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Stafford</a> took a deep shot to Tutu Atwell. </p><p>The pass fell incomplete around the 10-yard line, as the ball bounced off Atwell’s right arm. The "Monday Night Football" broadcast then showed a replay of the incomplete pass which showed Falcons cornerback Dee Alford grabbing Atwell’s left arm, hindering him from making the catch.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"They may have missed a pass interference," Buck said upon seeing the replay. </p><p>"I agree with you. He goes up kind of with one arm, he’s holding that arm down. I think that’s pass interference," rules analyst Russell Yurk responded.</p><p>"Watch the left arm of Atwell and the grab here, not allowing his arm to go up and make the catch. That’s a missed call," Buck reiterated.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bijan-robinsons-93-yard-touchdown-run-stuns-rams-falcons-star-leads-way-upset-win" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BIJAN ROBINSON'S 93-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUN STUNS RAMS AS FALCONS STAR LEADS WAY TO UPSET WIN</strong></a></p><p>If defensive pass interference had been called, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-rams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Rams</a> would have moved deep into Falcons territory with a chance to go for a touchdown to win the game or kick a field goal to tie. </p><p>Instead, there was no call, and play continued. On third down, Stafford hit star wide receiver Puka Nacua on the sideline for what looked to be a spectacular one-handed catch right at the edge of field goal range. </p><p>However, Nacua lost possession of the ball while falling down, leaving the Rams at fourth-and-10 with five seconds left. On fourth down, Stafford tried connecting with Nacua again, but the pass fell incomplete, and the Falcons pulled off the upset. </p><p>The Rams dropped to 11-5 with the loss but already had clinched a playoff spot. They cannot win the NFC West and will be the No. 5 or No. 6 seed depending on what happens in Week 18. The Rams play the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/arizona-cardinals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona Cardinals</a> at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday. </p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
