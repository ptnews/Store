<p>A top Senate Republican is demanding that the heads of several immigration-focused units at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</a> testify publicly before the Senate. </p><p>Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/rand-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rand Paul</a>, R-Ky., called on the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services (USCIS) to come before his panel, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, next month. </p><p>In three separate letters to acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott and USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, Paul noted that DHS had received "an exceptional amount of funding to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure our borders</a> and enforce our immigration laws."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/thune-steamrolls-dems-dhs-revolt-fetterman-defects-schumer-under-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THUNE STEAMROLLS DEMS' DHS REVOLT AS FETTERMAN DEFECTS, SCHUMER UNDER PRESSURE</a></p><p>"Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of those tax dollars and ensure the funding is used to accomplish the mission, provide proper support for our law enforcement, and, most importantly, protect the American people," Paul wrote.</p><p>"I write to request your testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs at an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/hearings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open hearing</a> by February 12, 2026," he continued. "Please provide your availability to appear before the Committee by the close of business on January 28, 2026."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-democrats-threaten-shutdown-blocking-dhs-funding-after-minnesota-ice-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SENATE DEMOCRATS THREATEN SHUTDOWN BY BLOCKING DHS FUNDING AFTER MINNESOTA ICE SHOOTING</u></strong></a></p><p>Paul’s request comes on the heels of the second fatal shooting involving a border patrol agent and U.S. citizen in the last month since the Trump administration ordered DHS to enter Minnesota. </p><p>Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good were both fatally shot by border patrol agents, which has prompted pushback from Senate Democrats and some Republicans on the Trump administration’s activity in the state. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/key-senator-wont-fund-dhs-ice-federal-agents-enter-his-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>KEY SENATOR WON'T FUND DHS AS ICE, FEDERAL AGENTS ENTER HIS STATE</u></strong></a></p><p>But Paul’s request is more focused on the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding element</a> of the situation.</p><p>Senate Democrats are gearing up to block the upcoming DHS funding bill, which could thrust the government into another shutdown. And Paul wants to know how the billion already allocated to the agency, likely through President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>’s "one, big beautiful bill," are being used. </p><p>Paul’s request also comes as DHS Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristi-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Noem</a> is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee in early March after several months of not responding to a pair of requests from Senate Judiciary Chair <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/chuck-grassley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chuck Grassley</a>, R-Iowa.</p>
