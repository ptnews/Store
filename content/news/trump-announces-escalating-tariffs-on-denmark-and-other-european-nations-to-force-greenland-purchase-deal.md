<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> announced the United States would impose 10% tariffs on multiple European countries unless Denmark agrees to the "complete and total purchase of Greenland," warning that global security and U.S. national defense were at stake.</p><p>Trump made the announcement in a lengthy Truth Social post on Saturday, arguing that the U.S. has subsidized Denmark and other European Union nations for decades by failing to charge tariffs and providing what he described as "maximum protection."</p><p>"We have subsidized Denmark, and all of the Countries of the European Union, and others, for many years by not charging them Tariffs, or any other forms of remuneration," Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115911344443637897" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-taps-republican-governor-serve-special-envoy-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP TAPS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO SERVE AS SPECIAL ENVOY TO GREENLAND</u></strong></a></p><p>"Now, after Centuries, it is time for Denmark to give back — World Peace is at stake!"</p><p>Trump wrote that both <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China</a> and Russia want Greenland and he said there was "not a thing that Denmark can do about it."</p><p>"They currently have two dogsleds as protection, one added recently. Only the United States of America, under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, can play in this game, and very successfully, at that!" Trump wrote. </p><p>"Nobody will touch this sacred piece of Land, especially since the National Security of the United States, and the World at large, is at stake."</p><p>Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland have "journeyed" to Greenland, for "purposes unknown," posing a very dangerous situation for the safety, security and survival of our planet.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/european-allies-working-plan-us-acts-acquiring-greenland-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>EUROPEAN ALLIES WORKING ON PLAN IF US ACTS ON ACQUIRING GREENLAND: REPORT</u></strong></a></p><p>"All of the above-mentioned Countries… will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America," Trump wrote. </p><p>On June 1, 2026, the tariff will be increased to 25%, he said. </p><p>"This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland."</p><p>In recent weeks, Trump has zeroed in on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Greenland</u></a>, the world’s largest island at a strategic crossroads in the Arctic, and floated the idea of tariffs being imposed on Friday. </p><p>A semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, Greenland is home to a crucial U.S. military base and has taken on growing strategic importance as melting ice opens new shipping lanes and access to a wealth of natural resources.</p><p>In his Saturday post, Trump said the United States has tried to purchase Greenland for more than 150 years but that Denmark has repeatedly refused. </p><p>He tied the push to modern weapons systems and the "Golden Dome," saying hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent on related security programs and that the system can only work at maximum efficiency if Greenland is included. </p><p>"The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades," Trump wrote. "Thank you for your attention to this matter!"</p><p>Trump’s remarks come as his administration awaits a Supreme Court ruling on whether some of the tariffs he imposed in 2025 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-tariff-boom-hits-record-highs-supreme-court-showdown-looms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>were legal</u></a>.</p><p><i>Fox News' Amanda Macias contributed to this report. </i></p>
