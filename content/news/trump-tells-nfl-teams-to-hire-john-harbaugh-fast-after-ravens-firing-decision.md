<p>Not that he needed one, but longtime NFL coach John Harbaugh received a rousing endorsement from President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> after the Baltimore Ravens fired him Tuesday, ending an 18-season run with the franchise.</p><p>Harbaugh’s tenure, which includes six AFC North titles, four AFC Championship Game appearances and a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/super-bowl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Bowl</a> title, came to an abrupt end when the organization announced that it had dismissed the coach following Sunday’s season finale. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/baltimore-ravens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ravens</a> battled the Pittsburgh Steelers in a crucial division matchup in which the winner would be crowned AFC North champs and punch its ticket into the postseason, while the loser would be sent packing. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>But a missed walk-off field goal attempt by rookie kicker Tyler Loop ended the Ravens’ season – and Harbaugh's time in Baltimore.</p><p> But the coach likely won’t stay on the market for long.  </p><p>"HIRE JOHN HARBAUGH, FAST," the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday morning. "HE, AND HIS BROTHER, ARE TOTAL WINNERS!!!" </p><p>John and Jim Harbaugh and their families met with Trump at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> over the summer.

What was that experience like?’" Harbaugh said at the time. "It was amazing. It was awesome. And I promise you I root for our president. I want our president to be successful just like I want my quarterback to be successful, and I want my team to be successful, and it was an amazing experience. It's not often you get invited, and you get a chance to do something like that as a family."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-chargers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Los Angeles Chargers</a> head coach Jim Harbaugh echoed his brother’s sentiments.</p><p>"There’s a lot of gratitude there to be invited to the White House to meet the president with my family, my mom and dad. President Trump was just great to my mom and dad. That meant so much. My brother John; his daughter Allison; my two daughters, Addie and Katie; and my sister Joanie; and my niece Ainsley.
