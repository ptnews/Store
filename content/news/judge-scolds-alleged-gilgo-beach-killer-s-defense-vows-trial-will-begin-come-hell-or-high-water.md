Brown told reporters, according to the Post. </p><p>In a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September ruling</a>, the judge determined the prosecution could use the DNA evidence in the case. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mangione-robinson-reiner-more-major-court-cases-dominate-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MANGIONE, ROBINSON, REINER AND MORE: MAJOR COURT CASES SET TO DOMINATE 2026</strong></a></p><p>Brown went on to insist his team was not stalling while working on the case, according to the Post.</p><p>"We’ve been working hard on this case," he said.
