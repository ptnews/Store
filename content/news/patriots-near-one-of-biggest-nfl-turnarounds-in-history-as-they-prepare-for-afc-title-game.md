<p>From 2001 to 2018, the New England Patriots were defined by 13 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AFC Championship Game</a> appearances, including one in each of the final eight seasons of that span.</p><p>After six seasons failing to make it back to the title game, and a span of falling to nearly rock bottom, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Patriots</a> are back to what feels like home.</p><p>The Patriots, with Bo Nix's injury, are the favorites to get back to the Super Bowl for the first time in the post-Tom Brady era, which is impressive in itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>However, nobody could have predicted this after what had gone on in recent years.</p><p>In the first three seasons after Brady left, the Pats went 7-9, 10-7 (made the playoffs with rookie <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mac-jones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac Jones</a>) and 8-9. But the 2023 and 2024 seasons both ended with 4-13 records.</p><p>The first of those was under <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bill-belichick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Belichick</a> in his final season with the team after 24 years. After Belichick left, Jerod Mayo was given the job, but he did not find success.</p><p>Mayo was given the short end of the stick and let go after one season, a move that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/patriots-legend-vince-wilfork-says-bs-jerod-mayo-firing-set-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">garnered a lot of controversy</a>. However, it appears to be all worth it.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/eli-manning-dishes-state-giants-after-unbelievable-john-harbaugh-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ELI MANNING DISHES ON STATE OF THE GIANTS AFTER 'UNBELIEVABLE' JOHN HARBAUGH HIRE</strong></a></p><p>The Pats then brought on Mike Vrabel, who has put himself in the Coach of the Year conversation after previous success with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tennessee-titans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tennessee Titans</a>.</p><p>The "1" in 4-13 was moved several places to the left as the Pats went 14-3, their highest win total since 2016, which was a Super Bowl-winning campaign.</p><p>Only four teams have won the Super Bowl just one season after finishing in last place in their division: the 1999 St. Louis Rams, the 2001 Patriots, the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Those Rams are also the only team to go from four wins one season to hoisting the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/super-bowl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lombardi Trophy</a> the next. However, since they only played a 16-game season, the Pats could become the first team to lose 13 games and follow up with a Super Bowl victory.</p><p>New England has opened as a 5.5-point favorite with Jarrett Stidham taking over for Nix, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/broncos-quarterback-bo-nix-suffers-season-ending-injury-during-playoff-win-vs-bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a fractured ankle</a> in their 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills last week.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
