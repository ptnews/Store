He was referring to their attitudes.</p><p>Skattebo, who just finished his rookie season, said the players coming out of college think they are "hot s---" because they enter the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL</a> having already made substantial money through NIL in college.</p><p>"The rookies that come in have made $2-$3 million in college, like they think they hot s---," Skattebo said during a recent appearance on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Roommates_Show" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"Roommates Show."</a> </p><p>"Like, there could be a vet that's been in the league for three years, four years, and this rookie could have come from college and already made more money than him."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Skattebo said he wasn’t talking about any of the rookies on the Giants, but he has seen rookies who have made money enter the NFL with a sense of entitlement.</p><p>"You could just tell by the way these college kids act now," Skattebo said. "There's some people act right, some people don't care that there was ever such thing as a rookie situation."</p><p><a href="https://foxnews.com/sports/steelers-mike-mccarthy-coach-reunion-aaron-rodgers-looms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STEELERS CLOSING IN ON MIKE MCCARTHY AS NEXT COACH, POSSIBLE REUNION WITH AARON RODGERS: REPORTS</strong></a></p><p>Skattebo said the veterans say that rookies don’t listen compared to years ago. The 23-year-old said he was a "good rook" and did what was asked of him.</p><p>"I got rookie duties cause I'm a rookie, and I'm not going to sit there and say, ‘No, f--- you.’ If my vets tell me to go get some snacks for the running back room for weeks in and weeks out, like I'm going to go get the snacks," Skattebo said.</p><p>"Some rookies are going to tell you, like, ‘Bro, I'm not going to get you snacks, bro. You can go get your own snacks.’ I'm not going to say no names, but there's some rookies that do that." </p><p>Skattebo, a fourth-round pick out of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/arizona-state-sun-devils" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona State,</a> endeared himself to Giants fans with his style of play.
