<p>North Korean leader <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kim-jong-un" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Jong Un</a> oversaw test-flights of hypersonic missiles and called for a stronger nuclear war deterrent, state media said Monday, as Pyongyang ramps up weapons displays ahead of a major political conference.</p><p>North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency said Sunday’s drill involving a hypersonic weapon system was designed to test combat readiness, sharpen missile troops’ operational skills and assess the country’s overall war deterrent.</p><p>"Through today’s launching drill, we can confirm that a very important technology task for national defense has been carried out," Kim said, according to KCNA. "We must continuously upgrade the military means, especially offensive weapon systems."</p><p>The announcement came a day after South Korea and Japan said they detected multiple North Korean missile launches, which they condemned as provocations. The tests also took place just hours before South Korean President Lee Jae Myung departed for China to meet with President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/xi-jinping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xi Jinping</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hegseth-applauds-south-koreas-plan-take-larger-role-defense-against-north-korean-aggression" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HEGSETH APPLAUDS SOUTH KOREA'S PLAN TO TAKE LARGER ROLE IN DEFENSE AGAINST NORTH KOREAN AGGRESSION</strong></a></p><p>If fully operational, a hypersonic missile would give North Korea the ability to evade U.S. and South Korean missile defense systems. While Pyongyang has conducted a series of hypersonic tests in recent years, many foreign experts remain skeptical that the weapons have achieved the necessary speed and maneuverability.</p><p>The latest tests follow recent launches of what North Korea described as long-range strategic cruise missiles and new anti-air systems, along with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-releases-images-development-nuclear-powered-submarine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state-released images showing progress</a> on what it claims is its first nuclear-powered submarine.</p><p>Experts say the regime is showcasing its weapons advancements ahead of the ruling Workers’ Party congress, its first in five years. The meeting is expected to review military achievements and could signal whether Kim plans to shift his approach toward the U.S. or revive long-stalled <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/nuclear-proliferation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear talks</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-days-after-hegseth-wraps-south-korea-visit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NORTH KOREA FIRES BALLISTIC MISSILE DAYS AFTER HEGSETH WRAPS SOUTH KOREA VISIT</strong></a></p><p>North Korea’s nuclear program is also expected to be discussed during the summit between Lee and Xi. Lee’s office said the South Korean president plans to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urge China</a> — Pyongyang’s main ally and economic lifeline — to play "a constructive role" in easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>Defending his push for nuclear expansion, Kim cited growing global instability. </p><p>"Why it is necessary is exemplified by the recent geopolitical crisis and complicated international events," he said.</p><p>The missile launches followed Saturday’s dramatic <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. military operation</a> that removed Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro from power and brought him to the U.S. to face narco-terrorism conspiracy charges. North Korea condemned the operation, calling it further proof of what it described as "the rogue and brutal nature of the U.S."</p><p>Analysts say the move is likely to reinforce Kim’s push to expand North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, which he views as essential to regime survival and national sovereignty in the face of what Pyongyang sees as U.S.-led hostility.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
