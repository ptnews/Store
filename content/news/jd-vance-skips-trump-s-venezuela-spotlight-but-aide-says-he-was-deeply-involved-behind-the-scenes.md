<p>Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jd-vance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD Vance</a> was not present at President Donald Trump’s news conference announcing the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro because of heightened security and secrecy concerns, according to a spokesperson, despite being closely involved in the planning and execution of the operation.</p><p>Trump briefed the press on the mission hours after Maduro was taken into U.S. custody, flanked by Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a>, War Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs.</p><p>Vance publicly praised the operation on X but did not attend the briefing. Vance did meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday to discuss the strikes but was not at Trump’s golf club Friday night when senior Trump officials monitored the mission because the national security team "was concerned a late-night motorcade movement by the Vice President while the operation was getting underway may tip off the Venezuelans." </p><p>"The Vice President joined by secure video conference throughout the night to monitor the operation. He returned to Cincinnati after the operation concluded."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-us-run-venezuela-until-safe-transition-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP VOWS US WILL 'RUN' VENEZUELA UNTIL 'SAFE' TRANSITION OF POWER</strong></a></p><p>Due to "increased security concerns," Trump and Vance are limiting the "frequency and duration" of time they spend together outside the White House, the Vance spokesperson told Fox News Digital. </p><p>"Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says," Vance wrote on X after the operation was made public. </p><p>"And PSA for everyone saying this was ‘illegal’: Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narco-terrorism. You don't get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas," he wrote in a separate post. </p><p>Trump, during his news conference, revealed that the U.S. will "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-us-run-venezuela-until-safe-transition-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run" Venezuela until a "safe, orderly"</a> transition of power can take place. </p><p>Pressed on whether <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>U.S. forces</u></a> would remain inside the country, Trump did not rule out a sustained troop presence. </p><p>"They always say boots on the ground, so we’re not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to," he said, confirming U.S. troops were already involved "at a very high level" during the operation. </p><p>Trump noted Venezuela’s vice president had been "picked by Maduro" but said U.S. officials were already engaging with her. </p><p>"She’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great," Trump said, adding that the issue was being handled directly by his team.</p><p>Venezuelan Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/maduros-presumed-successor-venezuelan-vice-president-delcy-rodriguez-possibly-in-russia-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delcy Rodriguez has been sworn</a> in as Maduro’s successor, and Trump did not say whether the U.S. will move to install opposition leaders Maria Corina Machado and Edmundo González Urrutia. </p><p>Vance, in the past, has voiced skepticism of U.S. interventions. </p><p>In a Signal chat leaked after the Houthi strikes last March, Vance told a group of Trump Cabinet officials, "I think we are making a mistake."</p><p>"[Three] percent of U.S. trade runs through the Suez Canal. Forty percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary," Vance said. </p><p>"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now."</p>
