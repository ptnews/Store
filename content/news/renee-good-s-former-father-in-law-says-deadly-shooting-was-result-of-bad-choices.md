<p>The former father-in-law of Renee Nicole Good is urging anti-ICE agitators to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn to prayer</a> rather than rage after her death. </p><p>Tim Macklin Sr., whose son was previously married to Good, said he does not blame anyone involved in the shooting and instead views the tragedy as the result of a series of "bad choices."</p><p>Macklin said the incident reflects a broader moral breakdown, warning the nation will keep fighting itself unless people return to faith.</p><p>"I have no blame for anybody. I want to be a peacemaker," Macklin said Friday on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Fox &amp; Friends."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/secretary-noem-says-gov-walz-rejected-dhs-help-protests-grip-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SECRETARY NOEM SAYS GOV WALZ REJECTED DHS' HELP AS PROTESTS GRIP MINNEAPOLIS</strong></a></p><p>"I heard somebody say earlier that this is a spiritual warfare, and it is, it's not political, it's spiritual," he added.</p><p>Activists have used Good’s death as justification for ongoing demonstrations and confrontations with law enforcement <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Minneapolis</a>. The protests began after 37-year-old Good was fatally shot during a confrontation with federal agents on Jan. 7.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-slams-walz-democrats-minnesota-following-governors-direct-appeal-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHITE HOUSE SLAMS WALZ, DEMOCRATS IN MINNESOTA FOLLOWING GOVERNOR'S 'DIRECT APPEAL' TO TRUMP</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Homeland Security</a> has defended the agent’s actions, saying Good attempted to "weaponize her vehicle" against them.
