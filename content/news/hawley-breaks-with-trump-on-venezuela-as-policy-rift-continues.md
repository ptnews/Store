<p>Of the five Senate Republicans who voted to curb President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> war powers, one has closely aligned himself in rhetoric with the president, but has a history of breaking with him in a variety of policy areas.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., often touts his relationship with Trump and regularly vouches for many of his policy desires in the Senate. But he has a tendency to buck the president, be it on key votes or policy pushes, and ends up on the receiving end of a digital tongue-lashing from Trump.</p><p>Thursday’s vote to rebuke future military action against Venezuela was another instance where Hawley was at odds with a furious Trump, who charged that he and his colleagues, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Todd Young, R-Neb., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/rand-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rand Paul</a>, R-Ky., "should never be elected to office again." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-gop-war-powers-defectors-says-should-never-elected-office-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP BLASTS GOP WAR POWERS DEFECTORS, SAYS THEY 'SHOULD NEVER BE ELECTED TO OFFICE AGAIN'</strong></a></p><p>Hawley quickly sought to do damage control while explaining his vote.</p><p>"I love the president. I think he’s doing a great job," he told reporters afterward. "I just think, when it comes to Venezuela, which is what we’re voting on today — I think that if the president should determine that he needed to put troops on the ground in a country, Venezuela, I just think in Article I, we would need to vote on that."</p><p>But Hawley has broken with Trump in several other areas, like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on healthcare</a>, unions and his push to ban stock trading in Congress.</p><p>The last time the president publicly berated the lawmaker was in July, when Hawley broke away from Republicans in a bid to get his Honest Act, originally named the PELOSI Act after the former House Speaker and her infamous stock portfolio, out of committee.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-politics/not-ready-prime-time-trump-republicans-slam-gop-leaders-stock-trade-ban-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME': TRUMP, REPUBLICANS SLAM GOP LEADER'S STOCK TRADE BAN BILL</strong></a></p><p>Trump at the time called him a "second-tier Senator," and questioned why he would "pass a Bill that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nancy Pelosi</a> is in absolute love with — He is playing right into the dirty hands of the Democrats."</p><p>The president’s anger in that situation was directed toward a version of the legislation that would have included himself and Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jd-vance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JD Vance</a> as part of the stock trade ban, which he and Hawley later cleared up after the lawmaker made clear that the latest iteration of the bill explicitly exempted him.</p><p>There are other, quieter areas where Hawley has strayed from Trump’s policy desires.</p><p>Most recently, Hawley voted for Senate Democrats’ three-year extension of since-expired Obamacare premium subsidies. Though not a direct rebuke of the president, Trump made clear that he did not support a simple extension of the subsidies.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/two-key-senate-republicans-join-push-overturn-trumps-federal-union-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TWO KEY SENATE REPUBLICANS JOIN PUSH TO OVERTURN TRUMP'S FEDERAL UNION ORDER</strong></a></p><p>Hawley also has differing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/labor-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">views on unions</a> compared to Trump, who signed two executive orders last year targeting federal labor unions. Still, he was skeptical of supporting a bill from Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, that would’ve reversed those orders.</p><p>"I don't know," Hawley told Fox News Digital at the time. "The public sector unions and private sector unions seem to be two different things."</p><p>Then there was Hawley’s public dissatisfaction with Trump’s "big, beautiful bill," over deep cuts to Medicaid that he and a handful of other Senate Republicans argued would have shuttered several rural hospitals throughout the country.</p><p>His anger was directed toward the lawmakers who crafted the healthcare portion, but in the moment, he threatened to vote against the legislation, which ultimately squeaked through the Senate with a single vote to spare.</p><p>"I think it was a huge mistake," Hawley said at the time. "I think this has been an unhappy episode here in Congress, this effort to cut Medicaid."</p><p>"And I think, frankly, my party needs to do some soul-searching," he continued. "If you want to be a working-class party, you've got to get delivered for working-class people. You cannot take away healthcare from working people."</p>
