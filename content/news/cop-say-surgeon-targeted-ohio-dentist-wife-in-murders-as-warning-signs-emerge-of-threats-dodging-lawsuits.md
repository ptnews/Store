<p>Separate court filings show that Dr. Michael McKee was facing several allegations of medical malpractice and negligence in the months prior to being charged in the deaths of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Ohio dentist</a> and his wife.</p><p>Federal court records reveal that McKee, a 39-year-old vascular surgeon, was named as a defendant in a civil rights and medical negligence lawsuit filed June 7, 2024, in U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. In a separate matter, state court records in Clark County show that McKee is also the primary defendant in an active medical malpractice lawsuit slated for a jury trial.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/las-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas-based lawyer</a> Dan Laird, McKee managed to evade legal justice before he allegedly killed his ex-wife, Monique Tepe, 39, and her husband, Spencer Tepe, 37.</p><p>"They tend to be highly responsible people," he told <a href="https://https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/michael-mckee-just-disappeared-nevada-lawyer-las-vegas-dan-laird-tried-track-doctor-months-before-spencer-monique-tepe-murders-weinland-park-home-columbus-ohio-dentist" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WSYX</a>. "They’re not the kind of people who just disappeared suddenly, and this was very surprising to us."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/family-quickly-believed-surgeon-ex-was-involved-ohio-dentist-couples-murder-co-worker-details-mishaps"><strong>FAMILY ‘QUICKLY BELIEVED’ SURGEON EX WAS INVOLVED IN OHIO DENTIST COUPLE'S MURDER AS CO-WORKER DETAILS MISHAPS</strong></a></p><p>Laird told WSYX that in a 2023 lawsuit, reviewed by Fox News Digital, McKee allegedly failed to train a physician’s assistant, leading to a patient being injured during treatment and needing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergency surgery</a>.</p><p>The lawyer said that he was duped when McKee allegedly gave fake addresses and "questionable" state-issued phone numbers.</p><p>"Interestingly, the address that was given to us by the surgery group that he worked for turned out to be a fake address," Laird told the local outlet, referencing Las Vegas Surgical Associates LLP. "It was an address that doesn’t exist."</p><p>Laird shared that he repeatedly, for years, made efforts to contact McKee, even going to former colleagues, including Dr. Peter Caravella, who is also listed in the malpractice suit. Fox News Digital has reached out to Laird for additional details.</p><p>"He said he has no idea where Dr. Michael McKee is now," Laird said. "He just disappeared."</p><p><strong>READ THE LAWSUIT – APP USERS, </strong><a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2026/01/2024-06-07-medical-malpractice-michael-david-mckee-amended-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE</strong></a></p><p>Rob Misleh, Spencer's brother-in-law, told NBC News that their family "quickly believed" that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/police-arrest-ex-husband-ohio-woman-slain-alongside-dentist-husband-double-murder-records-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">McKee was somehow involved</a> in their deaths. Misleh also told <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/michael-mckee-monique-tepe-spence-tepe/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NewsNation’s Ashleigh Banfield</a> last week that McKee threatened her life while the two were married.</p><p>"He was an emotionally abusive person when they were together, that is all I know," Misleh said.</p><p>In the first news conference following McKee's arrest, Columbus Division of Police Chief Elaine Bryant and Mayor Andrew Ginther said on Wednesday, Jan. 14, that this was a "domestic violence-related attack" and McKee "targeted" the couple.</p><p>Bryant also said that multiple weapons were taken from McKee's apartment in Chicago following his arrest, including, according to police, a preliminary link to one of the knives found.</p><p><a href="https://www.coferconnelly.com/about-us/lindsay-richards/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Attorney Lindsay Richards</a>, a former prosecutor, told Fox News Digital that while the civil lawsuit provides context since it appears that "his life was certainly spiraling out of control."</p><p>"The prosecutor will likely only look to the civil cases to see if there is any overlap in behavior or if it caused mounting pressure or stress for this suspect. It puts his life in context to paint a picture for a jury. Likely this won’t have much influence, if any, on the criminal case beyond just understanding circumstances."</p><p>"It does look like his life was certainly spiraling out of control, which is likely the only reason the prosecution would use these civil cases," she said.</p><p>McKee was arrested after allegedly killing the couple on Dec. 30, according to records. Police officers responded to a house located in Columbus' Weinland Park neighborhood around 10 a.m. Dec. 30 and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/police-arrest-ex-husband-ohio-woman-slain-alongside-dentist-husband-double-murder-records-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found the couple, both dead</a> with gunshot wounds. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/frantic-911-calls-detail-moments-before-columbus-dentist-wife-found-dead-theres-body" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FRANTIC 911 CALLS DETAIL MOMENTS BEFORE COLUMBUS DENTIST AND WIFE FOUND DEAD: 'THERE'S A BODY'</u></strong></a></p><p>In the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/nevada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nevada lawsuit,</a> an incarcerated man alleges that McKee, while serving on the Nevada Department of Corrections’ Medical Review Panel, knowingly delayed medical care for a serious condition.</p><p>According to the complaint, reviewed by Fox News Digital, the plaintiff experienced ongoing pain and complications over an extended period and underwent multiple procedures that were allegedly ineffective.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>The lawsuit claims <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approval for appropriate specialist care</a> was repeatedly delayed despite the plaintiff’s worsening condition. As a result, the complaint alleges, the plaintiff ultimately suffered permanent injury, including the loss of a testicle. McKee and the other defendants named in the federal case deny the allegations. The claims have not yet been ruled on by the court.</p><p>Neither the federal civil rights lawsuit nor the state malpractice case has reached a resolution. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SEND US A TIP HERE</strong></a></p><p>Both Nevada cases were active during roughly the same period that McKee would later be charged in Ohio in connection with the deaths of his ex-wife and her husband.
