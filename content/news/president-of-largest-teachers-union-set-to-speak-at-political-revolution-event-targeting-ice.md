The charter was intended to promote best practices in the teaching profession when the organization primarily focused on promoting the cause of education. In 2023, the National Education Association Charter Repeal Act of 2025 was introduced to remove that charter due to its political advocacy.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-school-board-member-chauntyll-allen-ripped-by-state-lawmaker-after-anti-ice-church-invasion-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER CHAUNTYLL ALLEN RIPPED BY STATE LAWMAKER AFTER ANTI-ICE CHURCH INVASION ARREST</strong></a></p><p>"The NEA can no longer be considered a public service worthy of its Federal charter as it has drifted substantially from its core mission and become a massive political operation dedicated to electing Democrats and imposing a radical progressive agenda on America’s schools," <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4595/text" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the bill text states</a>.</p><p>Pringle, who presides over roughly three million members, has previously been vocal about criticizing the Trump administration and endorsed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Kamala Harris</u></a> in the 2024 election.</p><p>Neither the National Education Association nor the Sunrise Movement responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p>
