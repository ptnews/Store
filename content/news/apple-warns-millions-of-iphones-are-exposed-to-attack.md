<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Apple iPhone</a> is the most popular smartphone in the United States and one of the most widely used devices in the world. An estimated 1.6 billion people rely on iPhones every day. That massive user base also makes the platform a prime target. </p><p>Over the past few weeks, Apple has been sending out warnings about a serious security flaw. New data suggests the risk could affect roughly half of all iPhone users.</p><p>That puts hundreds of millions of devices in potential danger right now.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

WebKit powers Safari and every browser that runs on iOS. According to Apple, the flaws were used in an extremely sophisticated attack that targeted specific individuals. The problem allowed malicious websites to trick iPhones and iPads into running harmful code. Once that happens, attackers could gain control of the device, steal passwords or access payment information. In simple terms, visiting the wrong website could have been enough.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/apple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple moved quickly</a> to release a fix. The patch is included in the latest software update. The problem is that many people have not installed it yet. Estimates suggest that about 50 percent of eligible users have not upgraded from iOS 18 to iOS 26. That would leave around 800 million devices vulnerable worldwide. Data from StatCounter paints an even worse picture. It estimates that only 20 percent of users have updated so far. Once security details become public, the risk grows fast. Attackers know exactly what to exploit.</p><p>Apple says the following devices are affected if they are not updated:</p><p>If your device appears on this list and you have not updated it, it is vulnerable.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/instagram-password-reset-surge-protect-your-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>INSTAGRAM PASSWORD RESET SURGE: PROTECT YOUR ACCOUNT</u></strong></a></p><p>There is no setting to flip and no safe browsing habit that fixes this issue. The vulnerability lives deep inside the browser engine. Security experts say there is no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully reduces the risk. Installing the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/software" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest software</a> is the only effective defense. Apple is no longer offering a security-only update for users who want to stay on iOS 18. Unless your device cannot run iOS 26, the fix is only available through iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2.</p><p>Updating is quick and usually painless. If automatic updates are enabled, the fix may already be installed.</p><p>If not, follow these steps:</p><p>Make sure your device is connected to Wi-Fi and has enough battery life or is plugged in.</p><p>Keeping your iPhone updated is critical, but it should not be your only line of defense. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by scanning malicious links, blocking risky websites and alerting you to suspicious activity before damage is done.</p><p>This matters even more when attacks rely on compromised websites or hidden browser exploits. Security software can help catch threats that slip through and give you extra visibility into what is happening on your device.</p><p>Think of it as backup protection. Software updates close known holes, while strong antivirus tools help guard against the next one.</p><p>Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/fake-error-popups-spreading-malware-fast" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> <u>FAKE ERROR POPUPS ARE SPREADING MALWARE FAST</u></strong></a></p><p>Apple rarely uses language like "extremely sophisticated" unless the threat is serious. This flaw shows how even <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trusted browsers</a> can become attack paths when updates are delayed. Waiting weeks or months to update now carries real consequences. If you use your iPhone for banking, shopping or work, this update should be treated as urgent.</p><p>How long do you usually wait before installing major iPhone updates, and is that delay worth the risk anymore?
