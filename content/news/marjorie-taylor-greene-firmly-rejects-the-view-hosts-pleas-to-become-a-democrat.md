<p>Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., rejected pleas from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/the-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The View" hosts</a> to become a Democrat on Wednesday.</p><p>"So maybe now you should become a Democrat!" co-host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joy-behar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joy Behar</a> told Greene after the Republican explained she felt strongly about the issue of affordability.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-announces-resignation-from-congress-after-president-trump-withdraws-endorsement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greene's last day</a> in Congress was Monday. The former lawmaker has publicly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-co-hosts-praise-marjorie-taylor-greene-breaking-trump-tell-her-welcome-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken with President Donald Trump</a> on multiple issues after being one of his biggest allies.</p><p>"It’s Democrats and Republicans together that have put us in nearly $40 trillion in debt. I don’t support a border invasion," she said, referring to the Democrats' immigration policy. "People like Laken Riley were murdered because our border was invaded. I don’t support those policies."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/marjorie-taylor-greene-suggests-house-speaker-johnson-under-direct-orders-from-white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE SUGGESTS HOUSE SPEAKER JOHNSON IS ‘UNDER DIRECT ORDERS’ FROM WHITE HOUSE</strong></a></p><p>Co-host Sunny Hostin asked if Greene would become an Independent or remain in the Republican Party.</p><p>"I haven’t said if I’m leaving the Republican Party, but my focus is America first," Greene said.</p><p>Hostin encouraged her, "You could make a statement here."</p><p>Behar then posed another question to Greene about spending and debt.</p><p>"Tell me if I'm wrong about this, because I’m just a person who watches the news. I’m not a pundit. I’m not anything," Behar said. "Every time a Democratic president leaves office, we're in a surplus. And then, when a Republican leaves, we're in a deficit."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jimmy-kimmel-welcomes-former-trump-superfan-mtg-reality-amid-ongoing-feud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JIMMY KIMMEL WELCOMES FORMER TRUMP ‘SUPERFAN’ MTG TO ‘REALITY’ AMID ONGOING FEUD</strong></a></p><p>Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said that it hadn't been true since former President Bill Clinton left office, and Greene added, "That is absolutely false."</p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> left office and we were $33 trillion in debt," Greene said. "The Democrats controlled Congress under Nancy Pelosi, spent trillions and trillions of dollars, and now it’s gone up even more. I’ve said both parties. I’m the one saying both parties. You’re the one defending the Democrat Party."</p><p>Behar agreed and said she was before adding, "One is worse than the other, let's put it that way."</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</strong></a></p><p>Co-host Sara Haines asked if Greene would ever become an independent and said she believed every politician should have to earn a vote.</p><p>"I agree with you," Greene responded.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/marjorie-taylor-greene-surprises-the-view-co-hosts-civility-praise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greene joined the co-hosts</a> for an interview in December amid her public back-and-forth with Trump. </p><p>Hostin thanked Greene during her first appearance on the show for not fighting with the co-hosts. </p>
