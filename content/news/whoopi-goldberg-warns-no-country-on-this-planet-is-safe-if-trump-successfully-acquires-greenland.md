<p>"The View" co-host Whoopi Goldberg argued Wednesday that if President Donald Trump can acquire Greenland, no country is safe from similar acquisitions by powerful leaders.</p><p>During a discussion on Trump's push to take control of the island territory owned by Denmark, co-host Sara Haines said, "I do think he might get Greenland."</p><p>"Greenland is not for sale!" fellow co-host Sunny Hosten declared.</p><p>Goldberg then warned, "Listen, if they allow him to do this, no country on this planet is safe."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-challenges-carney-davos-asserts-canada-should-grateful-golden-dome-missile-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP CHALLENGES CARNEY AT DAVOS, ASSERTS CANADA SHOULD BE 'GRATEFUL' FOR GOLDEN DOME MISSILE DEFENSE</u></strong></a></p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Trump has said that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/davos-braces-trump-amid-tensions-over-nato-greenland-global-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring Greenland</a> is a matter of national security to keep Russia and China in check as polar ice melts and shipping lanes expand, but NATO allies have rejected the idea.</p><p>Trump declared in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday that the U.S. is the only nation that is in the position to control and secure Greenland. </p><p>"We never asked for anything," Trump said of the U.S. working with NATO. "And we never got anything. We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won't do that. OK, now everyone say, ‘Oh good.’ That's probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tells-davos-us-alone-can-secure-greenland-insists-he-wont-use-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I won't use force."</a> </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-warns-pathetic-foreign-leaders-grow-backbone-bizarre-takedown-likening-trump-t-rex" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NEWSOM WARNS ‘PATHETIC’ FOREIGN LEADERS TO GROW A BACKBONE IN BIZARRE TAKEDOWN LIKENING TRUMP TO A T.REX</u></strong></a></p><p>"Across the board, our NATO alliance, I really think is at risk at this point," Hostin said in reaction to Trump. "Our allies are now speaking up vociferously, I mean you saw them saying we — this is a new world order. This — and that should be something that should be — we should be very afraid of, because right now with our alliance, China is on this side and Russia is on this side."</p><p>"Where will this sort of middle tier of countries go? They’re going to unite, and I think they may possibly go to China, which means that China becomes the new sort of ruler of the world order and that is a scary — I think that is a very scary thing for us," she added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</u></strong></a></p><p>Haines praised NATO’s strength as an alliance of western powers, saying, "The second it were to dissolve or separate, we would become immediately vulnerable to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-commander-says-russia-chinas-arctic-patrols-not-peaceful-purposes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia and China."</a></p><p>Haines offered a theory that Trump’s apparent de-escalation — saying he will not use force to acquire Greenland — may be part of a calculated negotiation tactic, noting, "I absolutely think Donald Trump backed off on the military stuff because I think he might get Greenland."</p><p>"I think he’s going to find a way, because if you start with an absurd demand, and then you come back and bring a more reasonable one," she added.</p>
