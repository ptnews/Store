<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/atlanta-falcons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta Falcons</a> did not have to do much thinking about their future when their season ended Sunday.</p><p>The team did not even wait for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Monday</a>, as it fired head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot on Sunday night.</p><p>The Falcons hired Morris ahead of the 2024 season, selecting him over candidates such as Bill Belichick, Mike Vrabel, Jim Harbaugh, Mike Macdonald and Ben Johnson.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>But Morris' results were not what the Falcons wanted, going 8-9 in back-to-back seasons.</p><p>"I have great personal affinity for both Raheem and Terry and appreciate their hard work and dedication to the Falcons, but I believe we need new leadership in these roles moving forward," owner Arthur Blank said in a statement. "The decision to move away from people who represent the organization so well and have a shared commitment to the values that are important to the organization is not an easy one, but the results on the field have not met our expectations or those of our fans and leadership. I wish Raheem and Terry the absolute best in their future pursuits."</p><p>Wildly enough, the team's record is the same as the division champion <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carolina Panthers</a>', so the Falcons were just one win away from making the playoffs for the first time since the 2017 season. One of those losses was to the New York Jets, who would have had the first pick in 2026 instead of the second if that game's result had been reversed.</p><p>Atlanta wound up winning their final four games, but it was not enough for them, or Morris and Fontenot.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/looking-back-sports-gambling-controversies-throughout-2025-nba-mlb-investigations-leading-way"><strong>LOOKING BACK AT THE SPORTS GAMBLING CONTROVERSIES THROUGHOUT 2025, WITH NBA AND MLB INVESTIGATIONS LEADING WAY</strong></a></p><p>Morris previously served as the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-rams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Rams</a>' defensive coordinator, winning a Super Bowl with them. He held numerous roles with the Falcons before going to Los Angeles, including serving as their interim head coach in 2020.</p><p>Morris initially replaced Arthur Smith, who served as the team's head coach for three seasons. Smith is now the offensive coordinator for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, who would make the playoffs with a win Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p>Perhaps the Falcons are kicking themselves for choosing Morris over several others. Vrabel won the AFC East in his first season with the New England Patriots, Johnson won the NFC North in his first year with the Chicago Bears, and Harbaugh is back in the playoffs with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-chargers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Chargers</a>.</p><p>There should be several names available to the Falcons, who are desperate to make the most of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/falcons-quarterback-miss-rest-season-due-acl-injury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Penix Jr.</a>, who will enter his third NFL season in September.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
