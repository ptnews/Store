Why?" Leno said during an appearance on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h361wQC3E4M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"Life Above the Noise with Maria Shriver"</a> podcast.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jay-leno-find-humor-wifes-dementia-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>JAY LENO TRIES TO FIND THE HUMOR DURING WIFE'S DEMENTIA BATTLE</u></strong></a></p><p>Shriver reacted, "In sickness and in health. … Then, when there is a sickness and you’re there, you’re saying people are like, ‘Whoa.’"</p><p>Leno said the most surprising comment came straight out of Hollywood.</p><p>"Yeah, my favorite thing was — and this is the most Hollywood thing — a guy said to me, ‘Uh, so are you going to get a girlfriend now?’ Well, no, I have a girlfriend. I’m married. I’ve been married 45 years. ‘Yeah, but you know what I mean.’ No … we're kind of in this together, you know. You can’t, ‘Honey, honey, I’ll be with my girlfriend, I’ll be back later.’ That was like the most Hollywood thing. It just made me laugh," he said.</p><p>Shriver asked whether the reaction had surprised him.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>"But you’re saying that people … their reaction has been surprising to you?" she asked.</p><p>"We just make a big deal out of it," Leno replied. "You’re just doing the right thing because you’re supposed to. Right? That’s kind of — that used to be the norm, and then when you strayed, that was the out-of-whack part. Now the out-of-whack part is fairly common, and staying and doing what you’re supposed to do is stunning to people. Well, we kind of made a deal, you know."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

She earned a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2002 for her advocacy supporting Afghan women living under Taliban rule.</p><p>The couple first met at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles in the 1970s.</p>
