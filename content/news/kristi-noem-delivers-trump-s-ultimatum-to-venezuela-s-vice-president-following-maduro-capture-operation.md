That's what is so fantastic about working for this president."</p><p>U.S. military forces launched a large-scale military operation in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/latin-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Caracas, Venezuela</u></a>, early Saturday, with special forces seizing Maduro and his wife in the process.</p><p>Maduro faces a 2020 indictment in the Southern District of New York, where he was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/venezuelan-leader-maduro-lands-new-york-after-being-captured-us-forces-drug-conspiracy-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transported to face prosecution</a>.</p><p><i>Fox News' Jonathan Turley contributed to this report.</i></p>
