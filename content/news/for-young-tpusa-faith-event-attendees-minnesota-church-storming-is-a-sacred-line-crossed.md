<p>RIVERSIDE, Calif.<strong> </strong>— Attendees at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/turning-point-usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turning Point USA</a> "Make Heaven Crowded" tour kickoff in Riverside, California, called the act of storming into churches "disgusting."</p><p>This comes after anti-ICE agitators stormed a church in Minneapolis during a service on Sunday. Dozens of agitators burst into the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-ice-mob-storms-minnesota-church-over-pastors-alleged-ties-immigration-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Cities Church sanctuary</u></a> roughly halfway through the service, attendees of the church told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-launches-civil-rights-investigation-after-minnesota-agitators-allegedly-storms-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a>.</p><p>Attendees shared their reactions with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a>. Brooklyn said when this happens, the agitators should be thrown out immediately. </p><p>"I don't think that it's right to be protesting negativity in churches. When you're in church, you're supposed to be there to be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closer to God</a> and to be on your walk with faith.

Go ahead and do that."</p><p>However, Joey said he doesn't agree with bringing violence and agitation to a church. </p><p>"All we're trying to do is to share the gospel and to give that message to people," he said.</p><p>Kaitlyn said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-launches-civil-rights-investigation-after-minnesota-agitators-allegedly-storms-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the church storming</a> was upsetting to hear, "because it is a place of worship," and churches ought to be respected.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gabbard-slams-democrats-hostility-towards-god-condemns-anti-ice-agitators-who-stormed-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GABBARD SLAMS DEMOCRATS' 'HOSTILITY TOWARDS GOD,' CONDEMNS ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO STORMED CHURCH</strong></a></p><p>Maddie said, although freedom of speech is important, it is important to have respect for one another.</p><p>"Respect for others no matter what their religion is or what they believe.
