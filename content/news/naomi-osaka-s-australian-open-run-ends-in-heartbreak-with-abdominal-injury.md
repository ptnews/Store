<p>Tennis star Naomi Osaka withdrew from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis/australian-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open</a> ahead of her third round match due to a left abdominal injury, ending her pursuit of her third title at the Grand Slam. </p><p>Osaka, who previously won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021, took to social media to announce her decision. She did not immediately provide details on the nature of her injury. </p><p>"I’ve had to make the difficult decision to withdraw to address something my body needs attention for after my <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last match,"</a> her statement posted to Instagram read. "I was so excited to keep going and this run meant the most to me, so having to stop here breaks my heart but I can’t risk doing any further damage so I can get back on the court." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>In a statement later provided by the tournament, Osaka said it was a left abdominal. </p><p>"It’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/injuries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an injury</a> I’ve had a couple of times before, and I thought I could push through it," the 28-year-old tennis pro said. "I played my last match with some pain, and I thought maybe if I gave myself a break before my match today, I would be able to handle it. But I warmed up, and it got a lot worse."</p><p>Osaka added that her body "changed quite a lot" after giving birth to her daughter, Shai, in 2023. During that time, she took a 15-month break away from competition before returning in 2024. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/naomi-osaka-sorana-cirstea-share-icy-post-match-moment-australian-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NAOMI OSAKA, SORANA CIRSTEA SHARE ICY POST-MATCH MOMENT AT AUSTRALIAN OPEN</u></strong></a></p><p>"I’m just grateful to be otherwise very healthy," she said, "and I hope that I’m able to play some good tennis for the rest of the year."</p><p>Although cut short, Osaka’s time at the Australian Open was highlighted by her fashion choices and a tense interaction with opponent Sorana Cirstea in the second round.</p><p>Cirstea appeared to take issue with Osaka’s attempts to motivate herself between points, prompting the four-time Grand Slam champion to make a quip about Cirstea after her 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 victory. </p><p>"Apparently a lot of 'c'mons' that she was angry about, but whatever," Osaka said during an on-court interview. "I mean, I tried to play well, I tried my best. She's a great player. I think this was her last Australian Open, so, OK, sorry she was mad about it."</p><p>Osaka later apologized, stating she doesn’t "like disrespecting people. That's not what I do."</p><p>In addition to her two Australian Open titles, Osaka won the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis/us-open-tennis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Open</a> in 2018 and 2020.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
