It was his first time back to Highmark Stadium since he was playing in the NFL.</p><p>There appeared to be no love lost between <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/buffalo-bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bills fans</a> and Brady. FOX broadcaster Kevin Burkhardt asked Brady during the game whether the legendary quarterback received a warm welcome from fans upon his arrival – this time, as a color commentator.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"Oh, warm embrace," Brady said. "A lot of people had the one-finger salute they were giving me as I looked down from the press box. Kinda reminded me how much they enjoyed me coming to down I guess."</p><p>Burkhardt added, "They said you are No. 1."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2025-nfl-playoff-picture-bracket-schedule-ahead-week-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2025 NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE, BRACKET, SCHEDULE: FULL UPDATE AFTER 49ERS BEAT BEARS</strong></a></p><p>Brady played 20 years for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New England Patriots</a> and another three with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during his career, only retiring after the 2022 season.

The Bills only won the AFC East after Brady left the division.</p><p>Brady owned the Bills throughout his career. He was 33-3 against the Bills, throwing for 9,032 passing yards and 72 touchdowns. It was the most wins he had against a team and the most touchdown passes he threw against one team. It was the second most yards he threw against a single team. The only other team he dominated as much was the New York Jets.</p><p>The Bills clawed back from a 13-point deficit against the Eagles in the fourth quarter but fell just short. Philadelphia won the game, 13-12.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
