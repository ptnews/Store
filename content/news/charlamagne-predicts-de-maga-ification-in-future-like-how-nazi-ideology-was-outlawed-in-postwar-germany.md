<p>Radio host Charlamagne tha God criticized the Trump administration during his Monday broadcast, telling listeners he believes there will come a day when President Donald Trump and his allies are prosecuted.</p><p>Charlamagne was one of many commentators reacting to the death of 37-year-old activist and nurse Alex Pretti following a confrontation with federal immigration agents. Debate surrounding Pretti’s death centered on the fact that he was carrying a holstered firearm, prompting a national discussion over whether individuals are within their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-view-hosts-defend-gun-ownership-check-tyranny-after-years-show-criticizing-gun-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">constitutional rights</a> to carry guns at protests, particularly during confrontations with police.</p><p>"How many people who serve this regime are going to continue to wipe their a-- with the document that represents the Supreme Law of the United States?" Charlamagne asked. "That document is the Constitution. I thought this document quite clearly outlined the structure of the federal government and guaranteed us fundamental rights. But clearly, that changed, and nobody told ‘We the people.’"</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-ice-agent-calls-police-non-cooperation-formula-disaster-after-second-minneapolis-shooting-death" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FORMER ICE AGENT CALLS POLICE NON-COOPERATION 'FORMULA FOR DISASTER' AFTER SECOND MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING DEATH</u></strong></a></p><p>Charlamagne objected to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s rhetoric about the shooting, particularly how she spoke about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/narratives-clash-after-trump-victims-family-react-second-minneapolis-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pretti’s possession of a firearm</a> at a protest. </p><p>"You ask, ‘Why did he bring a gun to a protest?’ Why do people bring guns to Starbucks?" Charlamagne asked. "Now all of a sudden it's wrong to carry any and everywhere, even though we live in a country that lets you carry damn near any and everywhere. Well, that's what happens when you are under an authoritarian government. Okay? They are hellbent on distorting our reality."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/border-patrol-commander-spars-cnn-host-over-deadly-minnesota-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>BORDER PATROL COMMANDER SPARS WITH CNN HOST OVER DEADLY MINNESOTA SHOOTING</u></strong></a></p><p>He continued, "I’m gonna tell y’all something, America, I don’t know how dark or how bad things are gonna get, but I keep hearing people referencing 1940s Germany. But I want y'all to remember something when you are bringing up that history. The Nazis ultimately lost. Nazi ideology was outlawed through de-nazification. One day we will see the de-MAGA-ification of this country. It will come. And you know what else happened? Leaders of the Nazi regime <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/acosta-far-left-podcaster-predict-democrats-expand-supreme-court-prosecute-trump-when-regain-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were prosecuted</a> and tried as war criminals."</p><p>The White House and DHS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</u></strong></a></p>
