<p>Former CNN host Don Lemon could face criminal charges for embedding with anti-ICE agitators who stormed a Minnesota church during a Sunday service, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett argued, saying journalism does not shield someone from liability when crimes are committed.</p><p>Lemon went viral Sunday for his reporting on the chaos that unfolded at Cities Church in St. Paul, telling viewers that "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the freedom to protest</a>" is what the First Amendment is all about. Protesters claimed a pastor inside was affiliated with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p>"The right to protest, Sean, does not extend to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/property" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private property</a> and certainly not to churches, which are protected spaces by law," Jarrett told Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity on Monday.</p><p>"This mob that stormed the church, harassed and terrorized the congregation, they can and should be prosecuted for a variety of crimes. Trespass, disorderly conduct, disturbing a religious meeting, and importantly, violating the FACE Act."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/anti-ice-agitator-who-stormed-minnesota-church-service-also-harassed-congregants-pete-hegseths-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ANTI-ICE AGITATOR WHO STORMED MINNESOTA CHURCH SERVICE ALSO HARASSED CONGREGANTS AT PETE HEGSETH’S CHURCH</strong></a></p><p>Jarrett said Lemon could find himself "prosecuted as a willing participant" in the incident.  </p><p>"He appears to have actually embedded himself with the mob, knowing full well that they intended to commit those crimes," he said. "Calling yourself a journalist, that's not a defense, and the First Amendment is not a shield from criminal charges."</p><p>Lemon stood by his reporting despite being <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/don-lemon-put-on-notice-doj-role-covering-protest-stormed-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>put "on notice"</u></a> by Harmeet Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-launches-civil-rights-investigation-after-minnesota-agitators-allegedly-storms-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOJ LAUNCHES CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATION AFTER MINNESOTA AGITATORS STORM CHURCH</strong></a></p><p>"It’s notable that I’ve been cast as the face of a protest I was covering as a journalist — especially since I wasn’t the only reporter there. That framing is telling," Lemon told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Fox News Digital</u></a> in a statement. "What’s even more telling is the barrage of violent threats along with homophobic and racist slurs directed at me online by MAGA supporters and amplified by parts of the right-wing press." </p><p>"If this much time and energy is going to be spent manufacturing outrage, it would be far better used investigating the tragic <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/renee-good-shot-four-times-including-head-fire-report-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death of Renee Nicole Good</a> – the very issue that brought people into the streets in the first place," Lemon continued. "I stand by my reporting."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Brian Flood, Joseph A. Wulfsohn, Lindsay Kornick and Greg Wehner contributed to this report.</i></p>
