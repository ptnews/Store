<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/buffalo-bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buffalo Bills</a>’ decision to fire head coach Sean McDermott after an overtime loss to the Denver Broncos in the playoffs drew rebuke from a Super Bowl champion.</p><p>Bruce Arians, who guided the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tampa-bay-buccaneers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> to a Super Bowl title during the 2020 season, ripped the Bills’ organization for the move on Tuesday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"This one baffles me," Arians said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imuMpQMPjmk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"The Pat McAfee Show."</a> "How Brandon Beane got elevated and Sean McDermott got fired, that just blows my mind, because they didn't have any damn players.</p><p>"The guy is one of the best coaches in the league and a great leader of men. He’s taken that team as close as you could get – couldn’t beat (Patrick) Mahomes. He didn’t throw any damn interceptions and the referees screwed him bad and he gets fired. I mean, come on man. And Brandon Beane gets a f---ing raise? I don’t get that one. That one blows my mind."</p><p>The Bills failed to get back to the AFC Championship Game after losing to the Broncos in overtime, following a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/broncos-bills-referee-defends-controversial-officiating-end-thrilling-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">controversial interception call</a>.
