"I'm excited for it because I know God's hand is going to be on me throughout that entire experience."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a> reached out to ABC for comment.</p><p>Chrisley's parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley of the reality show "Chrisley Knows Best," were both <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/trump-announces-pardon-todd-julie-chrisley-after-reality-tv-stars-fraud-tax-evasion-convictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pardoned by President Donald Trump</a> in May after being convicted on federal charges of bank fraud and tax evasion in 2022.

We're going to give you a pardon,' co-host Joy Behar said. "But poor people on Medicaid or food stamps, according to this administration, those are the real moochers in the country, and they have to be taken off of healthcare or food stamps."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/todd-julie-chrisley-home-holidays-after-trump-pardons-end-prison-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TODD AND JULIE CHRISLEY HOME FOR HOLIDAYS AFTER TRUMP PARDONS END PRISON TIME</strong></a></p><p>She added, "Americans need to understand what's going on. That's what's going on. Somebody like this guy, Chrisley, whatever his name is. I never saw the show. I've only seen clips where he's running around being rich. He gets let off the hook, but somebody, anybody that we might know who needs help doesn't get the help from this administration."</p><p>Co-host Ana Navarro suggested the pardons were not "ethical," though Sara Haines said they were "not surprising."</p>
