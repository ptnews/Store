FIND MORE ON THE TRUE CRIME HUB</strong></a></p><p>In order for the murder charge to fall under <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/federal-courts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal jurisdiction</a>, prosecutors need to show an underlying "crime of violence" was committed. They are alleging that was the stalking of Thompson across state lines before his murder.</p><p>The father of two <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lived and worked in Minnesota</a> and traveled to New York for a business conference. He was shot outside the hotel where it was supposed to be held.</p><p>Following oral arguments on the issue, Mangione's lawyers sent the judge a letter citing a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/appeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninth Circuit decision</a> that happened days later in United States v. Gomez. The appellate court found that a California law on assault with a deadly weapon does not meet the "crime of violence" threshold due to legal technicalities.</p><p>"It’s like a series of dominos — the only way that the federal government can get to a death penalty charge in their case is if the murder was committed during the course of a violent felony," said Joshua Ritter, a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney and Fox News contributor. "And the reason that they need that is because they need what’s called a federal hook to get them federal jurisdiction. So the way that they get that hook is through the stalking."</p>
