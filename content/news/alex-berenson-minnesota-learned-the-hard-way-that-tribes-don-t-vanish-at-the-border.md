<p><i>Nairobi, Kenya, December 2011:</i></p><p>I am in Kenya to research my seventh John Wells novel, "The Night Ranger." Wells is chasing American missionaries taken into the bush by Somali mercenaries. It is a change of pace for him, lower stakes than his usual work. It will turn out to be one of my favorite novels.</p><p>I have visited a vast Somali refugee camp in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">northern Kenya</a> and the Indian Ocean coast, where Somali kidnappers have recently captured and killed several Europeans.</p><p>Now I am back in Nairobi, talking about the problem of Somalia, which Kenyans face up close. Kenya is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mostly Christian</a>. Somalis are Muslim — and poor even by African standards. Kenya needs Western safari tourism for jobs and cash. The kidnappings have not helped. Kenyans would rather keep their neighbors out. But the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/united-nations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations</a> and international aid groups have given them little choice (oh, the irony; poor countries hate open borders even more than rich ones).</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-reviews-citizenship-cases-from-somalia-other-high-risk-countries-possible-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DHS REVIEWS CITIZENSHIP CASES FROM SOMALIA, OTHER HIGH RISK COUNTRIES FOR POSSIBLE FRAUD</strong></a></p><p>Anyway, I am having drinks at a hotel talking about Somalia with (white) non-governmental aid workers — they live well, these NGO types. And one says:</p><p>"Here’s what you need to know about Somalia. It’s on the ocean, right? [Somalia has the longest coastline in Africa, almost 2,000 miles.] But most Somalis, they can’t swim, can’t fish, they have no interest in the water. That’s how inward-facing they are, how tribal."</p><p>The words stuck with me. And 14 years later, they help explain the multi-billion dollar <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/epicenter-fraud-minnesotas-empty-stomachs-fake-autism-therapy-scandal-could-top-2-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somali corruption scandal in Minnesota</a>, which exploded into one of the biggest stories of 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bessent-turns-up-heat-sprawling-minnesota-fraud-schemes-treasury-personnel-deploy-ground" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BESSENT TURNS UP HEAT ON SPRAWLING MINNESOTA FRAUD SCHEMES AS TREASURY PERSONNEL DEPLOY ON THE GROUND</strong></a></p><p>The Somalis are tribal, but they are not alone.</p><p>It is impossible to understand the massive chunk of the world that runs from Morocco 4,000 miles east to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/pakistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pakistan </a>and south across Africa without realizing the importance of tribes. This area covers nearly two billion people, mostly Muslim — but includes hundreds of millions of Christians too. It is mostly poor, but it also has the wealthy Gulf Arab nations.</p><p>What it shares more than anything is a commitment to tribe as the center of identity. In Arab and Muslim countries, cousin marriage helps sustain tribal identity; marriages between cousins account for about two-thirds of all marriages in Pakistan and nearly as many in some <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arab countries</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/loeffler-vast-network-somali-nonprofits-ripped-off-minnesotas-welfare-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LOEFFLER: VAST NETWORK OF SOMALI NONPROFITS RIPPED OFF MINNESOTA’S WELFARE STATE</strong></a></p><p>Rates are somewhat lower in Somalia, because marriages help bind "clans" — not just already closely-related families — to each other.</p><p>Still, as a book on marriage in Arab and African countries explains:</p><p>"Overall, in the course of the marriage process in Somalia and Djibouti, collective interests are put before the interests of the two individuals getting married."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/somali-minnesotans-being-scapegoated-fraud-investigation-nyt-writer-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SOMALI MINNESOTANS BEING 'SCAPEGOATED' IN FRAUD INVESTIGATION, NYT WRITER CLAIMS</strong></a></p><p>I do not think most Americans can easily wrap their heads around how foreign these cultures really are to our way of thinking.</p><p>A society that does not even allow its members to choose their husbands or wives has a very different structure than Western societies that focus on individual rights — and the rule of law.</p><p>Yes, in both the West and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/columns/heritage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tribal societies</a>, the family is the core unit, which may be why Westerners have not seen this difference as clearly as they should.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/alex-berenson-minnesota-only-beginning-new-yorks-medicaid-grift-far-worse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ALEX BERENSON: MINNESOTA WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING: NEW YORK'S MEDICAID GRIFT IS FAR WORSE</strong></a></p><p>But in the West, each family is effectively independent. More powerful groupings are political, not familial, organized by population size and geography — cities, counties, states, nations.</p><p>In tribal societies, families stack together to gain power, which is why cousin marriage matters so much. Me against my cousin; me and my cousin against our second-cousin neighbors; our extended family against yours — all under the leadership of a clan leader. The clans may share territory, but not political leadership.</p><p>In the West, nation-states gather legitimacy from — at least in theory — providing all citizens equal justice under the law.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/massive-medicaid-fraud-scheme-puts-minnesotas-federal-funding-risk-investigators-warn-fallout-could-wide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MASSIVE MEDICAID FRAUD SCHEME PUTS MINNESOTA’S FEDERAL FUNDING AT RISK — AND FALLOUT COULD WIDEN</strong></a></p><p>Tribal societies do not have a similar overarching philosophical foundation. They work in practice as tribes compete and cooperate, sometimes in relatively calm equilibrium, sometimes under the autocratic leadership of the strongest tribe and its chiefs.</p><p>And sometimes in open conflict, up to and including civil war — as in the wars that wracked Somalia for decades.</p><p>When individual families from tribal societies come to Western countries, they have little choice but to adopt Western stacking mechanisms — to accept the rule of law and the authority of independent political jurisdictions. Plenty of individual Somalis have done just that.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/liz-peek-minnesotas-fraud-scandal-exposes-democrats-indifference-needy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIZ PEEK: MINNESOTA’S FRAUD SCANDAL EXPOSES DEMOCRATS’ INDIFFERENCE TO THE NEEDY</strong></a></p><p>But when they come en masse, as the Somali immigrants of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota</a> did, they may try to keep their tribal structures at least partly intact.</p><p>In November, the independent newspaper County Highway ran an extraordinary piece about the Somali fraud in Minnesota explaining how easily the community had reestablished itself along clan lines:</p><p>"The community is the result not of a voluntary movement of ambitious people seeking a new life in America, but of the US-government’s mass resettlement of entire families at once…</p><p>"The Somalis brought the language, culture, and complex clan system of their shattered homeland to Minnesota… the cultural forces that allowed Somalis to resume a version of their prior lives also had the effect of walling them off from other Minnesotans."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-not-just-minnesota-democrats-have-created-welfare-fraud-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IT'S NOT JUST MINNESOTA.
