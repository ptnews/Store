<p>From viral videos on TikTok to top officials, rhetoric against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-judge-blocks-ice-from-deporting-minnesota-man-5-year-old-son" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immigrations and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) and Trump administration enforcement operations has hit a fever pitch.</p><p>Figures from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to Bruce Springsteen to Stephen King have expressly likened ICE to the Gestapo, the notorious secret police of the Nazi Germany regime.</p><p>California Rep. Eric Swalwell, who is running for governor, has vowed to make ICE agents unhirable for state jobs, and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/soros-backed-philadelphia-da-vows-hunt-down-ice-agents-we-find-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vowed to "hunt down"</a> ICE agents, saying, "In a country of 350 million, we outnumber them. If we have to hunt you down the way they hunted down Nazis for decades, we will find your identities. We will find you. We will achieve justice."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rogan-defends-ice-raids-says-they-have-this-because-dems-let-millions-migrants-many-criminals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ROGAN DEFENDS ICE RAIDS, SAYS 'THEY HAVE TO DO THIS' BECAUSE DEMS LET IN MILLIONS OF MIGRANTS, MANY CRIMINALS</strong></a></p><p>Late-night hosts like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/stephen-colbert-says-f-ice-following-alex-pretti-shooting-condemns-trump-administrations-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Colbert</a> and Jimmy Kimmel have also gotten in on the act, with Colbert simply saying "F--- ICE" on his show Monday night, while Kimmel decried "just one atrocity after another, being committed by this gang of poorly trained, shamefully led, mask-wearing goons," in the wake of the federal agent killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.</p><p>Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson <a href="https://www.againstallenemies.net/p/americas-gestapo-kills-again" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">called for a</a> Nuremberg-like trial for Trump immigration advisor Stephen Miller, saying he hoped he was "tried and convicted" and then "f---ing dangles," suggesting he hoped he was hanged.</p><p>On the streets, rhetoric has included an interview of a man saying they will get Trump and his "goons" out of office, and then "there will be justice."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/moulton-says-ice-comparisons-nazi-germany-not-extreme-cnn-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MOULTON SAYS ICE COMPARISONS TO NAZI GERMANY ARE NOT EXTREME IN CNN INTERVIEW</strong></a></p><p>A nurse at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Health was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/vcu-anti-ice-nurse-fired-after-referencing-paralytic-drug-in-video-instructing-sabotage-of-ice-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired this week after</a> posting a series of videos suggesting ways to harm ICE agents.</p><p>The nurse in question used a now-deleted TikTok account, Redheadredemption, and was quickly identified as an employee at VCU Health. Popular X account LibsOfTikTok posted a compilation of three of the nurse's TikTok videos on X, sparking viral outrage.</p><p>"Single ladies, where these ICE guys are going, have a chance to do something, you know, not without risk, but could help the cause for sure," the nurse said in one video. "Get on Tinder, get on Hinge, find these guys. They're around. [If] they're an ICE agent, bring some ex-lax and put it in their drinks. Get them sick. You know, nobody's going to die. Just enough to incapacitate them and get them off the street for the next day. Highly, easily deniable."</p><p>In another video, she said, "Sabotage tactic, or at least scare tactic. All the medical providers, grab some syringes with needles on the end."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberal-social-media-platform-bluesky-flooded-users-calling-violence-against-ice-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIBERAL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM BLUESKY FLOODED WITH USERS CALLING FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST ICE AGENTS</strong></a></p><p>"Have them full of saline or succinylcholine, you know, whatever.

And we can't end this without good men in the streets, armed and ready to protect innocent people from being gunned down by these massed murderers, these fascist occupiers."</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</strong></a></p><p>In another <a href="https://x.com/MrAndyNgo/status/2015164997576360225?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">video on social media</a>, the self-described Antifa member said told people to "get their f------ guns and stop these f------ people."</p><p><i>Fox News' Peter D'Abrosca and Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report.</i></p>
