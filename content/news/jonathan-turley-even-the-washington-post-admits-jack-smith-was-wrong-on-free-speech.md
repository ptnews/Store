<p>For years, some of us have argued that President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>'s January 6th speech was protected under the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/first-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Amendment</a> and that any prosecution would collapse under governing precedent, including <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/395/444__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!24jKQhVArAd8lkfBQ7T6xlWD9ijI8s9pR_Z3bVKgtnA_2uyZ22hWcME2lO0_QLYIkjFLXkPIH1sZsi4x3XIq%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><i>Brandenburg v.

Now, years later, the Washington Post has <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/09/jack-smith-trump-judiciary-first-amendment/__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!24jKQhVArAd8lkfBQ7T6xlWD9ijI8s9pR_Z3bVKgtnA_2uyZ22hWcME2lO0_QLYIkjFLXkPIH1sZsq8osDI9%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">acknowledged</a> that Trump's speech was protected and that Smith "would have blown a hole in the First Amendment."</p><p>In this <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/key-takeaways-from-jack-smiths-testimony-house-judiciary-committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appearance before Congress</a>, Smith's contempt for the First Amendment was on full display. During his testimony, he was asked by Chairman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jim-jordan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim Jordan</a> (R-Ohio) whether Trump was entitled to First Amendment protections for his speech.</p><p>Smith replied: "Absolutely not. If they are made to target a lawful government function and they are made with knowing falsity, no, they are not. That was my point about fraud not being protected by the First Amendment."</p><p>The comment is entirely and shockingly wrong. Smith shows a complete lack of understanding of the First Amendment and Supreme Court precedent.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jack-smith-denies-politics-played-any-role-trump-prosecutions-house-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JACK SMITH DENIES POLITICS PLAYED ANY ROLE IN TRUMP PROSECUTIONS AT HOUSE HEARING</strong></a></p><p>First, the Supreme Court has held that knowingly false statements are protected under the First Amendment.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-urges-americans-unconditionally-support-free-speech-avoid-becoming-like-britain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILL MAHER URGES AMERICANS TO UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORT FREE SPEECH, AVOID BECOMING LIKE BRITAIN</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jonathanturley.org/2012/06/28/supreme-court-strikes-down-the-stolen-valor-act/__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!24jKQhVArAd8lkfBQ7T6xlWD9ijI8s9pR_Z3bVKgtnA_2uyZ22hWcME2lO0_QLYIkjFLXkPIH1sZsik_QVfS%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Supreme Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act.</a> In <i>United States v. Alvarez</i>, the Court held 6-3 that it is unconstitutional to criminalize lies — in that case involving "stolen valor" claims. Likewise, spewing hate-filled lies is protected. In Snyder v. Phelps, also in 2011, the Court said the hateful protests of Westboro Baptist Church were protected.</p><p>Second, calling such claims "fraud" does not convert protected speech into criminal speech. Trump was speaking at a rally about his belief that the election was stolen and should not be certified. Many citizens supported that view. It was clearly protected <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/political-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political speech</a>.</p><p>As I discuss in <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1668047047?tag=simonsayscom__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!24jKQhVArAd8lkfBQ7T6xlWD9ijI8s9pR_Z3bVKgtnA_2uyZ22hWcME2lO0_QLYIkjFLXkPIH1sZso1p7Wli%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><i>The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage,</i></a><i>" </i>Smith's prosecution was on a collision course with controlling Supreme Court precedent.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jonathan-turley-new-blasphemy-daring-laugh-wrong-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JONATHAN TURLEY: THE NEW BLASPHEMY? DARING TO LAUGH AT THE WRONG PEOPLE</strong></a></p><p>In Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that even calling for violence is protected under the First Amendment unless there is a threat of "<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep395/usrep395444/usrep395444.pdf__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!24jKQhVArAd8lkfBQ7T6xlWD9ijI8s9pR_Z3bVKgtnA_2uyZ22hWcME2lO0_QLYIkjFLXkPIH1sZsliq1DNt%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action</a>." Smith would have lost, but he has <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jonathanturley.org/2025/01/14/smiths-supreme-obstruction-special-counsel-explains-how-he-was-planning-to-circumvent-the-supreme-court-decision-in-fischer/__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!24jKQhVArAd8lkfBQ7T6xlWD9ijI8s9pR_Z3bVKgtnA_2uyZ22hWcME2lO0_QLYIkjFLXkPIH1sZsmGFqrQG%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a history of ignoring such constitutional protections</a>. That was the case when his conviction of former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell was unanimously reversed as overextending another law.</p><p>Trump was never charged with inciting the riot despite <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jonathanturley.org/2022/01/06/what-ever-happened-to-the-prosecution-of-donald-trump-for-incitement/__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!24jKQhVArAd8lkfBQ7T6xlWD9ijI8s9pR_Z3bVKgtnA_2uyZ22hWcME2lO0_QLYIkjFLXkPIH1sZsvppQs7J%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">pledges of Democratic D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine</a> to investigate Trump for that crime.</p><p>The reason is simple. It was not criminal incitement and Trump’s speech was protected under the First Amendment.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Post and other papers ran the same experts, who assured the public that no such protections existed. For example, Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe has made a litany of such claims, including his <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/jonathanturley.org/2022/06/17/without-any-doubt-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt-beyond-any-doubt-tribe-declares-trump-committed-attempted-murder/__;!!PxibshUo2Yr_Ta5B!24jKQhVArAd8lkfBQ7T6xlWD9ijI8s9pR_Z3bVKgtnA_2uyZ22hWcME2lO0_QLYIkjFLXkPIH1sZsr3ln7iB%24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">declaration</a> that President Donald Trump could be charged ("without any doubt, beyond a reasonable doubt, beyond any doubt")  with the attempted murder of former Vice President Michael Pence.</p><p>The Post has now recognized that Trump does indeed enjoy First Amendment protections and that Smith was a constitutional menace. The change reflects a commendable shift in the Post's editorial staff under owner <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeff-bezos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Bezos</a> and his new team at the paper.</p><p>The Post wrote:</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/first-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political speech</a> — including speech about elections, no matter how odious — is strongly protected by the First Amendment. It’s not unusual for politicians to take factual liberties. The main check on such misdirection is public scrutiny, not criminal prosecution.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</u></strong></a></p><p>Of course, fraud is a crime. But that almost always involves dissembling for money, not political advantage. Smith’s attempt to distinguish speech that targets ‘a lawful government function’ doesn’t work. Most political speech is aimed at influencing government functions.</p><p>Smith might think his First Amendment exception applies only to brazen and destructive falsehoods like the ones Trump told after losing the 2020 election. But once an exception is created to the First Amendment, it will inevitably be exploited by prosecutors with different priorities. Imagine what kind of oppositional speech the Trump Justice Department would claim belongs in Smith’s unprotected category.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-lawmakers-clash-over-trump-administrations-approach-hate-speech-censorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SENATE LAWMAKERS CLASH OVER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S APPROACH TO SPEECH, CENSORSHIP</strong></a></p><p>Smith also said he makes ‘no apologies’ for the gag order he tried to impose on Trump during the prosecution. The decision to criminally charge a leading presidential candidate meant the charges would feature in the 2024 campaign. Yet Smith fought to broadly limit Trump’s ability to criticize him or the prosecution in general, claiming such statements would interfere with the legal process.</p><p>Bravo.</p><p>This is precisely the argument that some of us have been making for years, while being relentlessly pursued by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the media</a>.</p><p>This is not meant as a criticism of the Post. At least the Post is now making a serious attempt to restore objectivity and accuracy to its coverage and editorials. As for Smith, his testimony confirms the worst assessments of his view of free speech. The only thing more chilling than his lack of knowledge of constitutional doctrine is his contempt for constitutional values.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/t/jonathan-turley" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY</u></strong></a></p>
