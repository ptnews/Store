He entered the church along with anti-ICE agitators and began filming, telling viewers that "the freedom to protest" is what the First Amendment is all about.</p><p>But Harmeet Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, disagrees with Lemon.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-fires-don-lemon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CNN FIRES DON LEMON, LEAVING LONGTIME ANCHOR 'STUNNED'</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-launches-civil-rights-investigation-after-minnesota-agitators-allegedly-storms-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOJ LAUNCHES CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATION AFTER MINNESOTA AGITATORS STORM CHURCH</strong></a></p><p>"A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest!
