<p>A month after President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> scrapped free national parks entry on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Gov. Gavin Newsom is responding – opening more than 200 California state parks for free to honor Dr. King while calling out Trump’s move.</p><p>Last month, the Trump administration reshaped when Americans can enter national parks for free, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-adds-his-birthday-free-national-park-day-while-axing-mlk-day-juneteenth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrapping Martin Luther King Jr. Day</a>, Juneteenth and National Public Lands Day from the 2026 calendar.</p><p>In their place, the administration added a slate of historically themed or presidentially themed dates. Flag day – which also happens to be Trump's birthday – becomes a fee-free day for the first time, along with Constitution Day, the 110th anniversary of the National Park Service and the birthday of Theodore Roosevelt.</p><p>Newsom announced Friday that, ahead of the 100th anniversary of Black History Month, he is directing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California State Parks</a> to offer free admission at more than 200 participating parks on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/environmental-group-sues-trump-replacing-national-park-pass-photo-his-own-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP SUES TRUMP FOR REPLACING NATIONAL PARK PASS PHOTO WITH HIS OWN IMAGE</strong></a></p><p>"While Trump works to erase Dr. King’s legacy, California will honor it," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gavin-newsom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsom said</a> in a press release. "Dr. King taught us that ‘darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.’ While the Trump administration tries to erase his legacy and turn national parks and monuments into places of exclusion and fear, California answers with light."</p><p>"That’s why I’m announcing free entry at California State Parks on Martin Luther King Jr. Day 2026 – because Dr. King’s legacy deserves to be honored, not erased," Newsom continued. "I’m encouraging all Californians to get outside on MLK Day, spend time in nature, reflect on Dr. King’s legacy, and reaffirm our commitment to advancing civil rights for all."</p><p>Free entry applies to vehicle day-use fees only and is available at more than 200 participating California state parks statewide, according to the governor’s office.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/national-park-gift-shops-ordered-purge-bias-driven-dei-woke-merchandise" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NATIONAL PARK GIFT SHOPS ARE ORDERED TO PURGE BIAS-DRIVEN DEI AND WOKE MERCHANDISE</strong></a></p><p>Free vehicle entry is being made possible by the California State Parks Foundation rather than taxpayer dollars. The foundation’s investment is intended to keep the state parks running while also planting seeds for a lifetime of connection to the state’s "natural and cultural treasures," Newsom’s office said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic leaders</a> framed the move as a direct rebuke of the Trump administration’s actions.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-adds-his-birthday-free-national-park-day-while-axing-mlk-day-juneteenth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ADDS HIS BIRTHDAY AS FREE NATIONAL PARK DAY WHILE AXING MLK DAY AND JUNETEENTH</strong></a></p><p>"As the federal government eliminates fee-free park days for holidays that celebrate Black history, California continues to revel in the glory of our civil rights pioneers," state Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson said. "Opening our parks for everyone to enjoy encourages loved ones to come together, give back, and honor Dr. King’s legacy while enjoying the natural beauty of the Golden State."</p><p>Some of the parks offering free entry include Big Basin Redwoods, Half Moon Bay, Sugarloaf Ridge, Doheny, Wildwood Canyon Park Property, Folsom Lake, Bidwell Mansion and Lake Oroville.</p><p>Some parks will still require a fee, including off-highway vehicle recreation areas, parks with per-person or tour fees such as Hearst Castle and locations operated by partner organizations.</p><p>A full list of participating parks is available at <a href="https://parks.ca.gov/MLKDay2026" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">parks.ca.gov/MLKDay2026</a>.</p>
