"I ran as fast as I could, and I'm sure they did too."</p><p>Todd said that when she turned around, both Mutchler and Pickard lay unconscious on the trail surrounded by pieces of the tree that had broken off about ten feet up.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mountain-lion-attacks-4-year-old-child-walking-family-washingtons-olympic-national-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MOUNTAIN LION ATTACKS 4-YEAR-OLD WALKING WITH FAMILY AT WASHINGTON'S OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK</strong></a></p><p>Two emergency room doctors happened to come up the trail behind the women and attended to Mutchler, who was still breathing, according to Todd. Pickard had been killed instantly.</p><p>Todd, who was not injured, said she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/camping-hiking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiked</a> to a nearby clearing and called 911 for help.</p><p>A rescue helicopter from Naval Air Station Whidbey Island arrived just over an hour later and hoisted Mutchler up in a basket.

Other hikers on the trail waited with Pickard's body until a rescue crew could hike up the trail, the paper reported.</p><p>Friends of the women told the paper that they were part of a group of friends who enjoyed the outdoors together, including hiking and taking trips on a bus to go skiing.</p><p>"They were the back-of-the-bus crowd," Sarah Rogers told the paper. "Absolutely a light. Happy, active, energetic and fun. Always out for a good time, in the best way."</p>
