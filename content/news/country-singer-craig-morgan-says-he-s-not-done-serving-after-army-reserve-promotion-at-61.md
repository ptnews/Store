<p>Country crooner Craig Morgan is incredibly "honored" after being promoted to chief warrant officer two (CW2) at the Pentagon.</p><p>During an interview with Fox News Digital, Morgan talked about the ceremony and being promoted by the Secretary of War, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pete-hegseth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pete Hegseth</a>. Morgan said it was a "huge honor" to have Hegseth officiate the ceremony, which took place at the Pentagon on Jan. 15.</p><p>"It was an honor. It's always a huge honor when one of the senior leaders in your chain of command pins your rank on," Morgan began.</p><p>After two decades of service while maintaining a full music career, "humility and pride" were the only two things going through his mind at the time of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/promotions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his promotion</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/country-star-craig-morgan-reenlists-army-reserve-59" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COUNTRY STAR CRAIG MORGAN REENLISTS IN ARMY RESERVE AT 59</strong></a></p><p>"Two things. Humility. I was honored beyond anything in hopes that people would recognize the pride that we have in our nation and our uniform as service members," he began.</p><p>"My objective is always to properly represent everyone else who don't get that opportunity. I think I answered both of my two things, pride and humility. Honor and pride, you know, which I tell people all the time. Those are two elements that I find that the only place that they are well-balanced is in the military and, for me, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/army" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Army</a>. I say military because I think the Army is representative of the military as a whole, but the Army, you know, it's very seldom do you meet someone who has such a wonderful balance of pride and humility. The military and, for me, the army, I think represents that better than any other occupation or people in the world," he continued.</p><p><strong>WATCH: CRAIG MORGAN SAYS TWO THINGS WERE GOING THROUGH HIS MIND AT HIS CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER II IN THE ARMY RESERVE PROMOTION CEREMONY</strong></p><p>Morgan explained that if any member of the United States military wants a senior ranking officer like Hegseth to promote them, they should just email him.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gary-sinise-says-veterans-day-reminder-the-mission-never-ends-those-who-serve" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GARY SINISE SAYS VETERANS DAY IS A REMINDER THAT THE MISSION NEVER ENDS FOR THOSE WHO SERVE</strong></a></p><p>"If the timing is such that it works, it works. The reason it worked for us [is] he happened to be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in D.C.</a> when I happened to be in D.C. I was there for meetings. I'm working on a suicide prevention program for the Army. I am heading up a music program. And we were there for meetings with people to converse about this particular project. And my promotion was due. I talked to my command and I said, 'Hey, if the secretary is there, I'm gonna see...' and they said, ‘Yeah, well, email him,’" Morgan explained.</p><p>Morgan reenlisted in the Army Reserve in 2023 at 59. Prior to that, the "That’s What I Love About Sunday" singer served 17 years in the Army and Army Reserve with the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions as an E-6 staff sergeant and fire support specialist and including Airborne, air assault and rappel master among his certifications.</p><p>Morgan held the rank of staff sergeant prior to his promotion. He continued touring and releasing new music in his civilian career while simultaneously serving in the Army Reserve.</p><p><strong>WATCH: CRAIG MORGAN ON WHY HE DECIDED TO REENLIST IN THE ARMY AT 59</strong></p><p>Morgan has also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/country-singer-craig-morgan-america-stands-for-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>worked with the USO</u></a> and has earned the Army’s Outstanding Civilian Service Medal and the USO Merit Award.</p><p>During his interview with Fox News Digital, Morgan discussed how he questioned whether he could realistically balance a successful music career and serve in the Army.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

I was in the Army at Fort Campbell when 'Almost Home' came on the radio. So, yes, there was times in my life when I questioned whether I could," Morgan said.</p><p>He said that pursuing music was one of the reasons he left the Army. "I just didn't feel like I was giving what I needed to be able to give to both occupations at that time," Morgan explained.</p><p>The musician said the reason he decided to reenlist "is simple."</p><p>"I'm at a point in my career, at that point in my career, I couldn't afford to hire people in the music world to assist me in accommodating me in all of that I was doing in my music. Now, I mean, good Lord, we're running a huge company. My music is a big company. And I have CEOs and I have CFOs and I have people equivalent to those jobs that take care of those things for me that I was doing by myself when I first started in the music business," he began.</p><p>Morgan said he's "smarter now" and leans in on some of the military resources that are offered to him.</p><p>"I am more attentive to the resources that are available to us as soldiers. I was a make-it happen, do-it-yourself kind of guy when I was in the Army. And I realized that we are a big team, and you need to rely on your teammates," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Morgan told Fox News Digital that he continues to serve in the Army because he's physically and mentally able to and wants to officially retire in service to his nation.</p><p>"That's the thing, number one — because I am physically able, and mentally and emotionally, spiritually able. Number two, I had 17 and a half years when I got out. Got nothing, and I'm not saying I want something, but the one thing that I do want is a letter hanging on my wall that says I served and retired from service to my nation," Morgan said. "I want that. I want that letter that says I served. Like, if you do 10 years, 12 years, 18 years... And you don't retire, you don't have a letter. You don't have something that says you retired from your service. You have to retire to get that letter, and I want that letter."</p>
