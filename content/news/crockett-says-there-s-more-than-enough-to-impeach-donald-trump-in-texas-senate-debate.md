<p>Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, called for impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump as she aims to win a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Senate</a> seat. </p><p>Crockett, an outspoken critic of Trump and his administration, made her stance clear during Saturday's debate with Texas State Rep. James Talarici, also a Democrat. </p><p>The pair engaged in an hourlong discussion before hundreds of labor union members at the Texas AFL-CIO political convention.</p><p>Crockett said she would support impeachment proceedings against Trump, starting with his use of tariffs.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-look-defunding-ice-impeaching-sec-noem-after-minneapolis-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>DEMOCRATS LOOK AT DEFUNDING ICE, IMPEACHING NOEM AFTER MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING</u></strong></a></p><p>"I think that there is more than enough to impeach Donald Trump," she said. "Ultimately, do I think we should go through the formal process? Absolutely."</p><p>Talarico stopped short of suggesting whether he would support impeachment proceedings, except to say, "I think the administration has certainly committed impeachable offenses."</p><p>Crockett has frequently criticized Trump over a range of matters, including his crackdown on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal immigration</a>. </p><p>She recently likened Trump's immigration enforcement campaign to Nazi Germany and accused the Supreme Court of sanctioning "modern day slave patrols."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/progressive-dem-jasmine-crockett-targets-trump-deportation-flights-new-track-ice-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PROGRESSIVE DEM JASMINE CROCKETT TARGETS TRUMP DEPORTATION FLIGHTS WITH NEW 'TRACK ICE' BILL</u></strong></a></p><p>"Because when we look at other places, say, places that did things like — oh, you know — go door to door, looking for people as they had to hide out, say — in an attic. Does that sound familiar to anybody?" Crockett asked during a hearing earlier this month titled: "Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s Deadly Assault on Minnesota."</p><p>Amid her criticism <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of Trump</a>, Crockett joined more than 70 House Democrats in co-sponsoring articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for "systemic abuses of power, violations of civil and constitutional rights, and deliberate obstruction of congressional oversight."</p><p>"Secretary Noem has violated her oath and weaponized ICE against American communities," said Crockett. "What we are witnessing is not public safety — it is state-sanctioned violence. It is unconstitutional, it is dangerous, and it demands accountability."</p><p>The Democratic nominee for the Senate race will be chosen in a March 3 primary. The winner will face the winner of the Republican contest between <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-senate-republicans-cornyn-paxton-hunt-01f1ffaf8a890e3017af407abe502e8f">Sen.
