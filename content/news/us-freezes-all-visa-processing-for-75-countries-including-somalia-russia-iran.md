<p><strong>FIRST ON FOX:</strong> The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Department</a> is pausing immigrant visa processing for 75 countries in an effort to crack down on applicants deemed likely to become a public charge. </p><p>A State Department memo, seen first by Fox News Digital, directs consular officers to refuse visas under existing law while the department reassesses screening and vetting procedures. </p><p>The countries include Somalia, Russia, Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Nigeria, Thailand, Yemen and more. </p><p>The pause will begin Jan. 21 and will continue indefinitely until the department conducts a reassessment of visa processing.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-know-about-minnesotas-feeding-our-future-fraud-center-trumps-latest-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT MINNESOTA’S ‘FEEDING OUR FUTURE’ FRAUD AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP’S LATEST CRACKDOWN</strong></a></p><p>Somalia has drawn heightened scrutiny from federal officials following a sweeping fraud scandal centered in Minnesota, where prosecutors uncovered massive abuse of taxpayer-funded benefit programs. Many of those involved are <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/somali-immigrant-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somali nationals or Somali Americans</a>. </p><p>In November 2025, a State Department cable sent to posts around the globe instructed consular officers to enforce <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-state-department-orders-global-visa-crackdown-under-revived-public-charge-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweeping new screening rules</a> under the so-called "public charge" provision of immigration law. </p><p>The guidance instructs consular officers to deny visas to applicants deemed likely to rely on public benefits, weighing a wide range of factors including health, age, English proficiency, finances and even potential need for long-term medical care.</p><p>Older or overweight applicants could be denied, along with those who had any past use of government cash assistance or institutionalization.</p><p>"The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people," State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement. </p><p>"Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-revokes-more-than-100000-visas-first-year-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVOKES MORE THAN 100,000 VISAS IN FIRST YEAR BACK</strong></a></p><p>While the public charge provision has existed for decades, enforcement has varied widely across administrations, with consular officers historically given broad discretion in applying the standard.</p><p>Exceptions to the new pause will be "very limited" and only allowed after an applicant has cleared public charge considerations.</p><p>A 2022 version of the public charge rule under the Biden administration had limited the scope of benefits considered — primarily to cash assistance and long-term institutional care — excluding programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federal supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, known as WIC, Medicaid or housing vouchers.</p><p>The Immigration and Nationality Act has long permitted consular officers to deem applicants inadmissible on public charge grounds, but President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> in 2019 expanded the definition to include a broader range of public benefits. That expansion was challenged in court, with portions ultimately blocked before being rescinded by the Biden administration.</p>
