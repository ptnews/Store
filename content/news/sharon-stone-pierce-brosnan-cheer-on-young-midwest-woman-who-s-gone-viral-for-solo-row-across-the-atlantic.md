Mighty woman you are. Best to you," Brosnan commented on one of Smith's videos.</p><p>"Today sounds like a day that breathing deep and powerful breathing," Stone commented on another.

"Here are my unsolicited thoughts on resilience. The first is that a huge part of resilience for me is remembering that everything ends. This too shall pass. All storms pass. I spend every moment I'm awake out on deck. And the past 42 days have really been a meditation and watching weather pass both up in the sky. And [my mind]."</p><p>"Another part of resilience has been having context and perspective for what I'm doing," she continued. "Yes, it's very difficult. It's tough and a lot of things hurt while I'm out here, but it is luxurious compared to what Atlantic Crossings would've been 200, 300 years ago. I have painkillers, I have vitamins. I have a desalinated to make fresh water. I can call my mom whenever I want. I can listen to any music I want to or any book. So it really is pretty comfortable compared to what human beings were doing 200 and 300 years ago, even a hundred years ago."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Smith said it's good for us to be "uncomfortable" sometimes. </p><p>"I think that's a part of the human experience," she added. "And the last is that every moment I have the conditions to be happy and being uncomfortable and being happy, not mutually exclusive. Now I'm saying this at the end of a very chill day. This is not the kind of thing I would've been saying earlier this week when we had really punchy weather and I was scared the boat was going to capsize."</p><p>"Those days I was calling my mom and crying," she admitted. "And so throughout this process, throughout training and rowing across the ocean, I thought that I would get to some arrival point where every moment I would just be totally zen and serene and be locked in and dialed in all the time. But that hasn't happened, and I don't think it ever will in my lifetime. And I think part of the process is forgetting and then remembering time and time again that this too shall pass."</p><p>Smith is expected to complete her race within the week. </p>
