<p>Actor and former governor of California <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/arnold-schwarzenegger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> is offering up his advice on motivation and achieving goals on New Year’s Day, writing on X that building a routine is "the only thing that works." </p><p>"As you start today with all the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/achievement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motivation in the world</a>, remember this: it won’t last," the bodybuilding legend said. </p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build a routine</a>. Do it no matter what. When you really can’t, don’t quit or beat yourself up, just do it the next day. Show up, over and over," he continued. </p><p>"It is the only thing that works," Schwarzenegger added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/valerie-bertinelli-jumps-50-times-rod-stewart-pushes-bricks-pool-celebrity-fitness-hacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VALERIE BERTINELLI JUMPS 50 TIMES, AND ROD STEWART PUSHES BRICKS IN A POOL: CELEBRITY FITNESS HACKS</strong></a></p><p>Schwarzenegger made the remarks in response to a Dec. 19 post in which he said, "My best advice is to stop using motivation as your only fuel." </p><p>"I know it feels great when you’re fired up, but it’s a short-term fuel source. That’s why the vast majority of people who start anything — diet, fitness, new projects — don’t finish. They run out of gas," the actor said at the time.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/katherine-schwarzenegger-pratt-says-shed-leave-hollywood-only-her-famous-family-goes-too" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER PRATT SAYS SHE'D LEAVE HOLLYWOOD BUT ONLY IF HER FAMOUS FAMILY GOES TOO</strong></a></p><p>"The only lasting fuel is routine. And you only get a routine by dragging yourself on the days when you have no motivation. Over and over," he added. </p><p>"I know that’s not the answer anyone wants. I wish I had a magic pill for you. But the only thing that works long term is showing up for yourself even when you don’t want to. Brute force," Schwarzenegger added. </p>
