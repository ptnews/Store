<p>A new season of "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/american-idol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Idol</a>" is upon us and the talent just keeps getting better and better. </p><p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VseK_aLnew" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">extended sneak peek</a> of the upcoming season, Jesse Findling — a 20-year-old college student with a severe stutter — left judges <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/carrie-underwood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carrie Underwood</a>, Lionel Richie and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/luke-bryan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Bryan</a> in awe after giving a "beautiful" performance despite the debilitating condition that has left him feeling embarrassed at times. </p><p>"I've been singing ever since I was little with my brother and sister," Findling told the judges. "We would pull up karaoke tracks, and we would just sing with each other, and since then I did choirs in school. If you haven't noticed, I have a stutter and that's really where kind of my love for singing came."</p><p>"I've had a stutter ever since I was little," Findling said during his confessional.  "It's something that I've struggled with since elementary school. It was something embarrassing for me, and it was something that I really had a hard time with. I wouldn't raise my hand in school, and it was just something that made me feel alone and something that I felt like I had to hide. So it was definitely hard."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/american-idol-winner-iam-tongi-reveals-dramatic-115-pound-weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'AMERICAN IDOL' WINNER IAM TONGI REVEALS DRAMATIC 115-POUND WEIGHT LOSS</strong></a></p><p>Findling said that singing has always "felt freeing" to him because his stutter disappears. </p><p>"When I sang, it was a way for me to express myself in a way where I didn't have to worry about being embarrassed or what people would think, or if somebody would laugh," he said. "It was an outlet for me when I was little, and it's still an outlet for me now."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lionel-richie-reveals-he-almost-became-priest-before-one-fans-comment-changed-his-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIONEL RICHIE REVEALS HE ALMOST BECAME A PRIEST BEFORE ONE FAN'S COMMENT CHANGED HIS LIFE</strong></a></p><p>"Walking out with a golden ticket would mean that everything that I've struggled with in the past, it's all led me here, and I can do whatever I want if I work hard," he added. </p><p>Before going into his own rendition of Bensen Boone's "In The Stars," he told the judges, "I've come a long way with it, and it doesn't hold me back."</p><p>During his performance, all three judges were visibly shocked at his approach. </p><p>"I don't think I blinked one time," Bryan said after the audition. "I mean, wow. You're a real singer. Thank you, man. I'm really proud of you. I love this show. I love this show because we get to meet kids like you."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>"Your voice is beautiful," Underwood added. "You have a beautiful vibrato, a beautiful tone. We could understand everything you were singing, and you were in the song emotionally, which just took us right there with you, so it was beautiful."</p><p>"Problem. What problem?" Richie asked. "You don't have a problem. The only thing wrong with you is you've got to figure out how you're going to navigate this career."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

We just haven't had voices like yours coming through those doors."</p><p>While holding his Golden Ticket, Findling told the camera that he's proud of the progress he's made.</p><p>"When I was singing that song, I was thinking of younger me who wouldn't speak in class, who was scared of what people thought of him and the fact that I got this is just proof that everything's working out how it should," he said. </p><p>"American Idol" returns Monday, January 26, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and streams the next day on Hulu.</p>
