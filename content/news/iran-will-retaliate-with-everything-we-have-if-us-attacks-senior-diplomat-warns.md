Unlike the restraint Iran showed in June 2025, our <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/armed-forces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powerful armed forces</a> have no qualms about firing back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack," he said.</p><p>"Iran’s message to President Trump is clear: The U.S. has tried every conceivable hostile act against Iran, from sanctions and cyber assaults to outright military attack—and, most recently, it clearly fanned a major terrorist operation—all of which failed. It is time to think differently. Try respect, which will allow us to advance farther than one may believe."</p><p>Trump is weighing military action against Tehran, with U.S. assets moving into the region amid international scrutiny over a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/armed-militias-fire-heavy-machine-guns-tehran-streets-deadly-night-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crackdown that has killed thousands</a> of anti-government protesters.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/keane-warns-irans-leadership-take-trump-at-his-word-military-assets-move-region" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KEANE WARNS IRAN'S LEADERSHIP TO TAKE TRUMP 'AT HIS WORD' AS MILITARY ASSETS MOVE INTO REGION</strong></a></p><p>The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which tracks human rights violations in Iran, said on Tuesday that <a href="https://www.en-hrana.org/day-twenty-four-of-the-protests-continued-communications-blackout-and-international-warnings-of-crimes-against-humanity/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">nationwide protests continued</a> into the 24th day.</p><p>The group's aggregated figures showed 629 recorded protests, the arrest of at least 26,314 people and the confirmed deaths of 4,519 individuals.</p><p>HRANA said 4,251 of those killed were protesters, including 33 children under the age of 18.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/human-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations Human Rights Council</a> announced it will hold a special session to address the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran on Friday.</p><p>Iranian journalist Elaheh Mohammadi said on X that for the past day or two, VPN access has worked only sporadically for 30 minutes to an hour at a time, allowing brief internet connections to let people know they are still alive. </p><p>"The city smells of death.
