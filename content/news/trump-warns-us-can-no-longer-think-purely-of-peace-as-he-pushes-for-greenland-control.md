<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> warned that he no longer feels obligated to think "purely of peace" as he argued the United States must have "complete and total control" of Greenland.</p><p>In a text exchange with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Trump wrote: "Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America."</p><p>"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also," he wrote. </p><p>"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States," Trump wrote. "The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-issues-stern-warning-nato-ahead-vances-high-stakes-greenland-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ISSUES STERN WARNING TO NATO AHEAD OF VANCE'S HIGH-STAKES GREENLAND MEETING</strong></a></p><p>Støre confirmed the text message, first reported by PBS, to Fox News. </p><p>The White House could not be reached to weigh in on the exchange. </p><p>"Norway’s position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter," the prime minister said in a statement. "We also support that NATO in a responsible way is taking steps to strengthen security and stability in the Arctic. As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government." </p><p>In a prior message to the U.S. president, Støre, on behalf of himself and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, had conveyed opposition to Trump’s proposed tariff increases on Norway, Finland and other countries and requested a phone conversation to de-escalate. </p><p>The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, but she offered the prize to Trump in a White House meeting Thursday. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/johnson-no-boots-ground-trumps-greenland-acquisition-plans-amid-military-speculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JOHNSON: 'NO BOOTS ON THE GROUND' FOR TRUMP'S GREENLAND ACQUISITION PLANS AMID MILITARY SPECULATION</strong></a></p><p>The prize is awarded by the Nobel Committee, which is made up of members appointed by the Norwegian parliament and intended to operate independently. </p><p>After Machado handed over her award to Trump, the Nobel Committee released a statement saying: "A laureate cannot share the prize with others, nor transfer it once it has been announced. A Nobel Peace Prize can also never be revoked. The decision is final and applies for all time."</p><p>Trump on Saturday said he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland, starting Feb. 1, increasing to 25% on June 1, until an agreement is reached for the purchase of Greenland.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-congressional-delegation-visits-denmark-amid-backlash-over-trumps-push-acquire-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>US CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION VISITS DENMARK AMID BACKLASH OVER TRUMP'S PUSH TO ACQUIRE GREENLAND</strong></a></p><p><strong> </strong>Members of the European Union debated the prospect of retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. in Brussels Sunday, but diplomats insisted on the need to seek de-escalation measures with the U.S. first. </p><p>The president has not ruled out the use of force to take the icy, 836,000 square mile island. </p><p>Trump and his advisors have pointed to Greenland’s position between North America and Europe as critical to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. missile defense</a>, early-warning systems and Arctic surveillance. The island sits along key air and sea routes that U.S. military planners view as increasingly important as melting ice opens new shipping lanes and expands the theater of great-power competition.</p><p>The administration has also warned that China and Russia have sought to expand their influence in the Arctic through infrastructure investments, scientific outposts and military activity, raising concerns that Greenland could become a foothold for adversaries if the U.S. does not take a more assertive role.</p><p>Greenland’s government and Denmark, which retains sovereignty over the territory, have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/greenlands-prime-minister-says-we-choose-denmark-over-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected any suggestion of U.S. control</a>, though the U.S. already maintains a military presence there through Pituffik Space Base, a key hub for missile warning and space surveillance.</p><p><i>Fox News' Madeleine Rivera and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.</i></p>
