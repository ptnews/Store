There have been just three instances where the MVP winner was not named to the first team at his respective positions.</p><p>The first was John Elway in 1987, when he won the MVP but <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-montana" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Montana</a> was named as the first-team All-Pro quarterback. In 2003, Peyton Manning and Steve McNair were named co-MVPs, but Manning was named as the first-team All-Pro quarterback.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>The other instance was last season, when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lamar-jackson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lamar Jackson</a> was named as the first-team All-Pro but Josh Allen won the MVP.</p><p>Stafford beat out Maye by 13 votes, marking it as the first time in his career that he has made the first-team All-Pro squad.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/falcons-hire-franchise-legend-matt-ryan-major-front-office-role" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FALCONS HIRE FRANCHISE LEGEND MATT RYAN TO MAJOR FRONT OFFICE ROLE</strong></a></p><p>In 17 games this season, Stafford completed 65% of his passes for 4,707 yards, 46 touchdowns and eight interceptions.
