<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California has announced</a> delays to a crackdown on thousands of immigrants who were given commercial driver's licenses in the Golden State, prompting quick condemnation from the federal government, which had pushed for the licenses to be canceled after a series of deadly crashes involving foreign drivers.</p><p>The move to push back the cancellations until March is designed to give officials more time to resolve the concerns of federal authorities, according to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles. It affects about 17,000 noncitizens.</p><p>The Trump administration and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had set a Jan. 5 deadline, warning that failure to meet it could cost California $160 million in federal funding. California authorities are also facing a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/migrant-truckers-sue-california-dmv-over-canceled-commercial-drivers-licenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class-action lawsuit brought</a> by immigration advocates who argue that the crackdown unfairly targets truckers and bus drivers.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatens-cut-75m-from-pennsylvania-over-illegal-immigrant-cdl-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP THREATENS TO CUT $75M FROM PENNSYLVANIA OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CDL SCANDAL</strong></a></p><p>Newsom, however, accused Duffy of "federal mismanagement" in a tweet of his own.</p><p>"YOUR staff told CA DMV they were open to an extension 8 days ago. In fact, FMCSA agreed an extension made logistical sense and was reasonable (in a meeting on Dec. 18)," he wrote. "DMV relied on that guidance and acted accordingly."</p><p>Separately, the Asian Law Caucus and the Sikh Coalition, along with the law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP, filed the lawsuit last week, arguing the cancellations would "result in mass work stoppages" immediately upon the deadline.</p><p>Impacted drivers get another 60 days before the cancellations take effect, according to the DMV.</p><p>Duffy sharply criticized the move on X.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/transportation-secretary-duffy-warns-rampant-fraud-commercial-driver-licensing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SEAN DUFFY WARNS 'RAMPANT FRAUD' IN TRUCK LICENSING PUTS AMERICANS AT RISK DURING HOLIDAY TRAVEL</strong></a></p><p>"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads," Duffy wrote earlier this week.
