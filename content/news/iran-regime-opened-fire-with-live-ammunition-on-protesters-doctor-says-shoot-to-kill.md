Live ammunition."</p><p>Describing scenes in Isfahan, which is a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major protest hub</a>, the doctor said streets were stained with blood as security forces deployed heavier weapons.</p><p>"A large amount of blood, about a liter, had pooled in the gutter and blood trails extended for several meters," the doctor claimed.</p><p>"The level and intensity of violence increased step by step," he said before describing a change in aggression on Jan. 9.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-hospitals-overwhelmed-injuries-protests-rage-across-islamic-republic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRANIAN HOSPITALS OVERWHELMED WITH INJURIES AS PROTESTS RAGE ACROSS ISLAMIC REPUBLIC</strong></a></p><p>"On Friday night, I heard automatic gunfire.
