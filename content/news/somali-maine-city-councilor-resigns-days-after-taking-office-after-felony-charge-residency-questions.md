"I hope my resignation serves as a call to action for those who remain — an opportunity to reflect on the values of respect, inclusivity and kindness that should guide our public service."</p><p>Osman’s resignation comes after a grand jury indicted him on Dec. 1 on charges stemming from the alleged theft of two firearms between Nov. 15, 2023, and Oct. 11, 2024, according to the outlet.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/somali-un-ambassador-linked-questionable-cincinnati-health-service-agency-rfk-jr-deputy-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SOMALI UN AMBASSADOR LINKED TO QUESTIONABLE CINCINNATI HEALTH SERVICE AGENCY, RFK JR.
