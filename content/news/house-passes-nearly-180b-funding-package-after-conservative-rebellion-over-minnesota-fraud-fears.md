<p>The House of Representatives has passed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-rolls-out-174b-spending-bill-jan-30-shutdown-fears-grow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal funding package</a> totaling nearly $180 billion, putting Congress one modest step closer to averting a government shutdown at the end of this month.</p><p>The legislation accounts for just over $174 billion aimed at partially or fully funding the departments of Commerce, Justice, Interior and Energy, including laying out the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/nasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget for NASA</a>, the FBI and federal nuclear energy projects.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly supported the final package of three bills, which passed by a 397-28 vote. Twenty-two Republicans and six Democrats voted against the bill.</p><p>It comes after the bills ran into opposition from conservative Republicans on Wednesday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-last-minute-move-block-gop-funding-plan-sends-lawmakers-home-early" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEMOCRATS' LAST-MINUTE MOVE TO BLOCK GOP FUNDING PLAN SENDS LAWMAKERS HOME EARLY</strong></a></p><p>Members of the House Freedom Caucus and others on the GOP's right flank were incensed in particular by the Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) appropriations bill, which they felt rank-and-file lawmakers did not get proper input on putting together.</p><p>It's one of 12 annual appropriations bills that Congress is tasked with passing each fiscal year. Congressional leaders who negotiated the legislation along bipartisan lines originally included it in a three-bill "minibus" that, when passed in the House and Senate, would mean half of those dozen bills are finished.</p><p>Conservatives also threatened to kill the bill during a procedural vote on Wednesday afternoon over the inclusion of a community funding project requested by "Squad" member <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ilhan-omar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilhan Omar</a>, D-Minn.</p><p>The bill would have given $1,031,000 to Generation Hope's Justice Empowerment Initiative, which "helps justice-involved Minneapolis residents break the cycle through job training and support," according to a description of the funding request.</p><p>But conservatives argued that the funding was just another vehicle allowing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/somali-immigrant-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota's Somali community</a> to fraudulently take taxpayer funds at a time when the state is grappling with a massive fraud scandal enveloping its public service programs.</p><p>"Fraud is running RAMPANT in Minnesota under the failed leadership of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a>. Democrats want to use earmarks to funnel another $1 MILLION to a Somali-led so-called ‘Justice Empowerment Initiative’ that ABUSES taxpayer dollars," Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said on X.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-rolls-out-174b-spending-bill-jan-30-shutdown-fears-grow" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CONGRESS ROLLS OUT $174B SPENDING BILL AS JAN 30 SHUTDOWN FEARS GROW</strong></a></p><p>Community project funding, also known as an "earmark," is a request that specific lawmakers make that allows their districts to directly benefit from Congress' federal funding bills.</p><p>"Earmarks, the currency of corruption, they're coming back in full force in these products. And I just don't support it," Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told reporters Wednesday morning.</p><p>He was among the conservatives who Speaker <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Johnson</a>, R-La., negotiated with on the House floor for nearly half an hour as the minibus was in danger of failing during a procedural vote to allow for it to be debated.</p><p>In the end, House GOP leaders agreed to hold a separate vote on the CJS spending bill while also removing Omar's earmark, which was also supported by Minnesota's two Democrat senators.</p><p>"Chalk one up for the good guys. Proud to work the last two days to stop the outrageous Ilhan Omar $1 million Somali earmark. Much more to do," Roy posted on X.</p><p>The CJS bill was first voted on, followed by the remaining two as a pair, and then a final vote on combining them before sending them to the Senate.</p><p>House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., told Fox News Digital he still anticipated "a number of" his members will still vote against that bill specifically.</p><p>The legislation passed along bipartisan lines Thursday, with top House Appropriations Committee Democrat Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., celebrating that the bill was free of GOP "poison pills" earlier this week.</p><p>Its funding levels are above what was originally requested by President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> but below the threshold extending former President Joe Biden's fiscal year 2024 spending levels via another continuing resolution would have brought.</p><p>The White House has also issued a statement of support for the minibus, which will be combined back into one bill <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-races-avoid-government-shutdown-time-ticking-lingering-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before being sent to the Senate</a>.</p><p>Congress has until the end of Jan. 30 to find a solution on the remaining six appropriations bills to avert another shutdown.</p>
