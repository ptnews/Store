Grace Meng, New York State Sens. Joseph Addabbo Jr. and Leroy Comrie Jr., New York State Assembly members Andrew Hevesi and Sam Berger, and New York City Council Member Lynn Schulman issued a joint statement condemning the attack</p><p>"We are outraged by the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/anti-semitism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antisemitic attack</a> that occurred in our district, in which a Rabbi was verbally harassed, physically assaulted, and threatened for being Jewish," the statement said. "This was a targeted act of hate, and it has no place in our community or anywhere in New York City."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-leaders-gather-jerusalem-address-global-antisemitism-surge-holocaust-remembrance-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NETANYAHU SOUNDS ALARM ON ANTISEMITISM AT HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY GATHERING</strong></a></p><p>"No one should ever fear for their safety because of their religion, identity, or beliefs," the lawmakers said in the statement.

It is imperative we do everything in our power to combat these rancid acts of antisemitism and hate in all its forms."</p><p>Schumer added that he is "grateful" the rabbi is okay, and thanked the NYPD.</p><p>New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani posted that he is "horrified" by the attack.</p><p>"On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, New Yorkers were confronted with a painful truth: antisemitism is not a thing of the past—it is a present danger that demands action from all of us," Mamdani said. "There is no place for antisemitism in our city. I stand in solidarity with Jewish New Yorkers and my administration is committed to rooting out this hatred."</p>
