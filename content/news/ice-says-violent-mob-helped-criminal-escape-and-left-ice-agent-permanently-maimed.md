<p>Federal officials say violent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unrest in Minneapolis</a> directly derailed an immigration arrest, leaving a suspect with a serious criminal history at large while a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent was permanently maimed after a protester bit off part of his finger.</p><p>U.S. Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino said during a press conference on Sunday that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Border Patrol</a> and ICE agents were forced to abandon a targeted operation after crowds interfered, assaulted officers and turned the scene chaotic.</p><p>As a result, he said, the suspect escaped custody – a failure he blamed solely on the decisions made by politicians, activists and those who confronted law enforcement officials.</p><p>"This individual is still roaming the streets today," Bovino said. "This individual walks the streets today because of those choices made by politicians and those, perhaps, weaker-minded constituents that chose to follow directions of those politicians.
