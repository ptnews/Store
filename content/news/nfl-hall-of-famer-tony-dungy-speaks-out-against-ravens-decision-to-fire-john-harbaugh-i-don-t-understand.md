<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL Hall of Famer</a> and Super Bowl-winning coach Tony Dungy spoke out in response to the Baltimore Ravens' recent firing of coach John Harbaugh. </p><p>In an X post Tuesday, Dungy praised Harbaugh and said he doesn't "understand" the decision to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ravens-fire-head-coach-john-harbaugh-18-seasons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fire him</a>. </p><p>"I can’t believe what things have come to in the NFL. John Harbaugh has coached the Baltimore Ravens for 18 years. He took them to the playoffs 12 times. He won a Super Bowl for them. The last 4 years they were 10-7, 13-4, 12-5, 8-9," Dungy wrote.</p><p>"They made the playoffs 3 straight years and missed this year because their kicker missed the game winning FG on the last play of the season. And he was fired???? I’m sorry but I don’t understand. Good luck Baltimore in finding a better coach."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </u></strong></a><a href="http://FOXNEWS.COM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong><u>FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p><p>Harbaugh's firing came two days after the Ravens failed to secure the AFC North title, losing a winner-take-all game against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Pittsburgh Steelers</u></a> in Week 18 when rookie kicker Tyler Loop missed a game-winning field goal. </p><p>"Following a comprehensive evaluation of the season and the overall direction of our organization, I decided to make a change at head coach," Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said. "Today I informed John that he has been relieved of his duties.</p><p>"This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, most importantly, as a great man of integrity."</p><p>The Ravens also posted a statement from Harbaugh. </p><p>"Well, I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today. It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE &amp; APPRECIATION," Harbaugh said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/browns-fire-coach-kevin-stefanski" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>BROWNS FIRE HEAD COACH KEVIN STEFANSKI AFTER SIX SEASONS</u></strong></a></p><p>"Gratitude to the owner and organization who was willing to bring in a head coach who made his mark with Special Teams success. A difficult thing to do… and Appreciation for all the moments, all these years, that are etched into eternity. I hope a legacy built on Faith, always Fighting, always Believing."</p><p>Harbaugh quickly becomes the top head coaching candidate for teams searching to fill their own vacancies. Those teams include the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>New York Giants</u></a>, Atlanta Falcons, Tennessee Titans, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders.</p><p>Harbaugh owned a 180-113 record and a 13-11 postseason record during his 18 seasons with the franchise. He led the Ravens to a Super Bowl victory during the 2012 season after going 10-6.</p><p>Harbaugh, the brother of Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh, has the most road playoff victories in NFL history, showcasing his pedigree when the game matters most.</p><p>Through his 18 seasons, Harbaugh has only had a losing record three times, with his worst mark being the 2015 campaign at 5-11. The other two were 8-9 seasons in 2021 and 2025.</p><p>Harbaugh secured double-digit victories in 11 of those 18 seasons, including three straight from 2022-24.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Scott Thompson contributed to this report. </i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
