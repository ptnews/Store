<p>Jodie Foster says Hollywood nearly turned her into someone she couldn’t live with.</p><p>In a candid interview, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jodie-foster-being-cemented-hollywood-wont-persuade-sons-watch-films-dont-seem-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar-winning actress</a> admitted that fame pushed her toward becoming an "a--hole," a realization that ultimately led her to step away from the industry.</p><p>When speaking about her decision to quit acting after turning 50, Foster traced it back to the commanding tone she heard herself take with someone on set.</p><p>"I asked someone for a cappuccino?" she recalled in a <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/features/jodie-foster-studio-movies-female-directors-clarice-1236622804/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Variety interview</a>. "I did <i>what</i>? I thought I knew what I was talking about and ranted on for 45 minutes? I didn’t send that person a condolence letter when their mom died? I wasn’t at their wedding? I disappeared for four months and expected everybody to be my friend when I came back?"</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jennifer-lawrence-at-peace-never-returning-hollywood-after-taking-breaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JENNIFER LAWRENCE WAS 'AT PEACE' WITH NEVER RETURNING TO HOLLYWOOD AFTER TAKING BREAKS</strong></a></p><p>Foster, who had been famous since her breakout role at age 12 in 1976’s "Taxi Driver," feared she was becoming a "creature of Hollywood — in other words, an a--hole," according to the media outlet.</p><p>Instead of leaning into celebrity privilege, Foster made a rare choice and stepped away from the spotlight.</p><p>Foster revealed that she had lost interest in acting — and eventually found it again.</p><p>At this point in her career, Foster said she's done chasing Hollywood’s approval and the industry’s obsession with constant relevance.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ariana-grande-confesses-fame-left-her-traumas-revealing-chat-nicole-kidman" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ARIANA GRANDE CONFESSES FAME LEFT HER WITH 'TRAUMAS' IN REVEALING CHAT WITH NICOLE KIDMAN</strong></a></p><p>"The movies I make," she said, "will be about this big life that I have, not about references from 365 days a year in a reality show."</p><p>Foster’s recent comments come after she revealed a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jodie-foster-haunted-horrific-dog-tragedy-believes-she-gave-up-what-she-loved-most-hollywood-success" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traumatic childhood memory</a> that has haunted her throughout her life.</p><p>During an interview with AARP magazine in December, the 63-year-old actress shared that the incident occurred in May 1976 on the night before the premiere of her movie "Taxi Driver" at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/cannes-film-festival" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Festival de Cannes</a>. Before Foster departed for France to attend the festivities, tragedy struck.</p><p>"My puppy, he was a little guy," she recalled. "Went careening down these very slick steps and hit a wall. His whole skull exploded into blood right in front of me."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Foster was just 13 years old at the time. She later told <a href="https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/jodie-foster-a-private-life/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AARP</a> the traumatic incident — and its aftermath — had a lasting impact on her life.</p><p>Despite the emotional toll, Foster attended the Cannes premiere of "Taxi Driver," where critics praised her performance in the film — a breakout role that would later lead to her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/oscars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Oscar nomination</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Foster said she locked herself in a bathroom after the premiere, worried her sudden success had come at a supernatural cost — fearing she might have inadvertently entered into a deal with the devil.</p><p>She drew a comparison between her mindset then and that of the lead character in the 2001 French-language romantic comedy "Amélie," which starred Audrey Tautou.</p><p>The official logline for the movie reads: "Despite being caught in her imaginative world, young waitress Amélie (Tautou) decides to help people find happiness. Her quest to spread joy leads her on a journey during which she finds true love."</p><p>"I had a whole internal thing that I had to give up the thing I loved most to get [this success]," Foster said. "It was like ‘Amélie,’ total magical thinking about how powerful I was. What a sad, sad moment. I didn’t talk to my mother about it, or anyone."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Ashley Hume contributed to this report.</i></p>
