<p>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Angie Craig compared <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immigration</a> and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations to images out of 1930s Germany while discussing efforts to potentially defund the agency on Wednesday.</p><p>Craig's home state of Minnesota has been at the center of recent tensions involving the agency after the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/cellphone-video-released-deadly-minneapolis-ice-agent-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE-involved shooting</a> of a woman in Minneapolis last week.</p><p>MS NOW's Ana Cabrera asked Craig on "Ana Cabrera Reports" what Democratic lawmakers like her could do to "rein in" the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minnesota-lawsuit-trumps-ice-invasion-wont-succeed-legal-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA LAWSUIT OVER TRUMP'S ICE 'INVASION' WON'T SUCCEED: LEGAL EXPERT</strong></a></p><p>"Well, there’s no way in hell I’m voting to give one cent to Trump and Kristi Noem’s ICE. I won’t send one penny to these people who are terrorizing the people of Minnesota," Craig responded, adding that there needs to be a bill to prevent ICE agents from entering schools and churches.</p><p>Cabrera then asked Craig if she would support an effort to shut down the government over ICE funding.</p><p>"Look, I’m not in the room with leadership, but what I can tell you what is happening in America, the path that we are traveling, certainly reminds me of many of the images that we saw in the 1930s in Germany, and we should stand up to this lawless administration. And right now, nothing should be off the table," Craig said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/schumer-backs-plan-fly-democratic-senators-nyc-cops-minneapolis-confront-ice" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SCHUMER BACKS PLAN TO FLY DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, NYC COPS TO MINNEAPOLIS TO CONFRONT ICE</strong></a></p><p>In a comment to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a>, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson denounced the comments as "dangerous, untrue smears."</p><p>"ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them because of dangerous, untrue smears from elected Democrats. ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism. Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals is simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens," Jackson said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/joe-rogan-calls-minnesota-ice-shooting-footage-horrific-very-ugly-shoot-someone-face" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JOE ROGAN CALLS MINNESOTA ICE SHOOTING FOOTAGE 'HORRIFIC,' 'VERY UGLY' TO SHOOT SOMEONE IN THE FACE</strong></a></p><p>Ahead of a Jan. 30 deadline to avert a partial government shutdown, some progressive Democratic lawmakers have suggested using the latest government funding round as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reporters-notebook-progressives-eye-shutdown-leverage-rein-ice-venezuela-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential leverage to defund ICE</a> operations.</p><p>"We should use every means at our disposal to do it, including the appropriations process," said Rep.
