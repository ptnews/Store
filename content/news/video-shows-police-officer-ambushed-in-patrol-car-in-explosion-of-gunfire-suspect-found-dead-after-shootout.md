<p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenville, South Carolina, police officer</a> was ambushed in his patrol car after a suspect pulled up beside him and opened fire in an attack captured on surveillance video and ending with the gunman dead.</p><p>Video released by the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Carolina</a> Law Enforcement Division (SLED) shows a vehicle pulling into a parking lot and stopping directly alongside the driver’s side of a marked patrol car. Seconds later, gunfire flashes in the darkness as the suspect opens fire before driving away, leaving the officer wounded inside the patrol car.</p><p>The wounded officer was rushed to a hospital for treatment and has since been released.</p><p>Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis said deputies later located the suspect’s vehicle, setting off a brief pursuit.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/officer-injured-suspect-allegedly-rams-law-enforcement-vehicles-during-charlotte-immigration-raids" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OFFICER INJURED AFTER SUSPECT RAMS LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES DURING CHARLOTTE IMMIGRATION RAIDS</strong></a></p><p>Authorities say there were multiple exchanges of gunfire during the chase, which ended with a crash and the suspect dead inside his vehicle. The Greenville County Coroner identified the suspect as David William Lane, 42.</p><p>"This incident stemmed from an ambush-style attack against a Greenville city officer," Lewis said.</p><p>The Greenville County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to Fox News Digital that it had prior contact with Lane before Sunday’s ambush. In a statement, the sheriff’s office said deputies received multiple complaints from neighbors Jan. 1 and Jan. 2 regarding Lane’s comments and behavior.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspect-shooting-3-pennsylvania-officers-being-sought-stalking-trespassing-charges-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SUSPECT IN SHOOTING OF 3 PENNSYLVANIA OFFICERS WAS BEING SOUGHT ON STALKING, TRESPASSING CHARGES: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>Deputies responded to and investigated each complaint, determining that while the behavior was concerning, it did not rise to the level required for a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminal arrest warrant.</a></p><p>Out of an abundance of caution, the sheriff’s office said administrators at the Hunting Downs apartment complex coordinated with deputies to hire off-duty sheriff’s deputies for security. That detail began on Jan. 8 to help ensure the safety of residents.</p><p>A mother whose daughter lived at the complex shared security video with Fox Carolina that appears to show Lane approaching her daughter’s apartment earlier this month while carrying a gun. The woman told the outlet Lane had been stalking her daughter and others at the complex and made threatening statements.</p><p>SLED was asked to investigate the ambush by both the Greenville Police Department and the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office. The agency says it will conduct a thorough, independent investigation, including witness interviews and forensic testing, before submitting its findings to prosecutors. No additional details are being released at this time.</p><p>The agency said the incident marks the second officer-involved shooting in South Carolina in 2026 and the first involving the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office this year. SLED said the state recorded 45 officer-involved shootings in 2025, seven of which involved the sheriff’s office.</p>
