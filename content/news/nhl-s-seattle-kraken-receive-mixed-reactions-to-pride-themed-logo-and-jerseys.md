<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nhl/seattle-kraken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Kraken</a> of the NHL received mixed responses Thursday after revealing a new Pride-themed logo and uniforms. </p><p>The logo features a rainbow-colored unicorn with its body contorted in the shape of the letter "S" placed within a rainbow-bordered outline of the team's typical "S" logo. The team hosted its <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/red-sox-fans-treated-drag-show-fenway-team-promotes-inclusivity-during-pride-night-event" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pride Night</a> event Thursday. </p><p>Many users on social media mocked the team for the design. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p><p>The most-liked response to the team's original X post said, "Humiliation ritual for your players." </p><p>Another user wrote, "We must defeat the Woke Mind Virus." </p><p>One user jokingly called the team "The Seattle Karen's."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/save-womens-sports-2025-culture-war-timeline-year-tides-turned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>'SAVE WOMEN'S SPORTS' 2025 CULTURE WAR TIMELINE — THE YEAR THE TIDES TURNED</u></strong></a></p><p>However, many other fans were quick to praise the Kraken for the design. </p><p>"In a time when many are shying from supporting the LGBTQ community in fear of retribution, it’s awesome to see Seattle stand tall and unapologetic," one user wrote. </p><p>Another fan wrote, "These are hard."</p><p>Many pro sports teams will debut LGBTQ-themed logos and merchandise during June for Pride month. However, the Kraken rolled out this new branding six months earlier. </p><p>The NHL announced in 2023 that players would <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nhl-players-will-not-wear-pride-jerseys-during-warm-ups-anymore-keeping-focus-on-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no longer be permitted</a> to wear specialty sweaters for themed nights during warm-ups, including Pride, Hockey Fights Cancer or military appreciation celebrations, a policy that was later updated to include Pride stick tape. </p><p>"That’s just become more of a distraction from really the essence of what the purpose of these nights are," Commissioner Gary Bettman said at the time. "We’re keeping the focus on the game.
