What the hell kind of question is that?" McVay snapped back. "We’ve been totally present. I know if he wants to, he’s still playing at a pretty damn good clip.</p><p>"I mean, he’s the MVP of the league. If he’s not, I mean I got respect for everybody else, but this guy played at a level that’s just different."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/super-bowl-lx-what-know-about-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SUPER BOWL LX: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GAME</strong></a></p><p>Stafford and McVay won a Super Bowl with the Rams to cap the 2021 season – his first with the Rams.
