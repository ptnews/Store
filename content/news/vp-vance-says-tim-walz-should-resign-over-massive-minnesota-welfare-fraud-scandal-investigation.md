<p>Vice President JD Vance says Minnesota's fraud scandal reflects a larger scheme and that the Trump administration believes there is a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationwide fraud</a> ring perpetrated by illegal aliens and others taking advantage of the American welfare system.</p><p>"Anybody who is involved is going to get prosecuted," Vance vowed on "Jesse Watters Primetime" Wednesday.</p><p>The vice president’s comments come as the Trump administration is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-demands-california-hand-recipient-lists-10b-paused-fraud-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pausing over $10 billion</a> to five Democrat-run states, including California, over concerns that money was fraudulently given to noncitizens.</p><p>Vance addressed whether he thinks <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/emmer-warns-walz-could-end-up-in-cuffs-amid-minnesota-fraud-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz</a>, who announced Monday he would not seek re-election, should resign over his state’s fraud scandal, which is estimated to be at least $9 billion.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/james-comer-accuse-tim-walz-being-asleep-wheel-fraud-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JAMES COMER TO ACCUSE TIM WALZ OF BEING 'ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL' AT FRAUD HEARING</strong></a></p><p>"I think Tim Walz should resign," Vance told Fox News host Jesse Watters. "I almost feel bad for the guy, except for the fact that he should’ve seen this."</p><p>Minnesota’s scandal is a "massive failure of government," Vance said.</p><p>"It’s not just that people are getting welfare who shouldn’t get welfare. … It's bigger than that," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vance said</a>.
