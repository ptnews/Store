<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carolina Panthers</a> made a major decision on quarterback Bryce Young’s future on Tuesday.</p><p>Panthers general manager Dan Morgan said the team is picking up the fifth-year option on Young’s contract. The option will be worth more than $26.5 million for the 2027 season, according to multiple reports.</p><p>If the Panthers had declined <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bryce-young" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Young’s fifth-year option,</a> it would have signaled that the team might have been looking to move in another direction.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>The Panthers won the NFC South with an 8-9 record this year, while Young had the best season of his three-year career, a pivotal one for him. The 24-year-old was benched for six games last season after struggling.</p><p>The 2023 No. 1 overall pick came back and played better down the stretch after being benched, but needed to show continued improvement for the Panthers to feel comfortable committing to him long-term. This season, Young set career highs in passing yards (3,011), passing touchdowns (23), completion percentage (63.6%) and passer rating (87.8).</p><p>Young also set a career-high by throwing 11 interceptions this season. On the ground, Young rushed for 216 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/packers-star-calls-bears-coach-ben-johnson-troll-his-profane-outburst" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PACKERS STAR CALLS BEARS COACH BEN JOHNSON A 'TROLL' FOR HIS PROFANE OUTBURST</strong></a></p><p>The Panthers fell to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-rams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Rams,</a> 34-31, in Young’s first career playoff game on Saturday, but the former Alabama star delivered one of the best performances of his career in the loss.</p><p>Young completed 21 of 40 passes for 264 yards with one passing touchdown and one interception while rushing for 24 yards and a touchdown. While the box score numbers do not appear great, Young extended plays with his legs and made plenty of big-time throws, helping put the Panthers in position to win late.</p><p>Young threw a perfect seven-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jalen Coker to give the Panthers a 31-27 lead with 2:39 left in the fourth quarter. That would have been a game-winning drive for Young if <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/matthew-stafford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Stafford</a> didn’t lead the Rams down the field to the lead.</p><p>The Panthers quarterback has consistently elevated his game late, as he has 12 career game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime since he entered the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL</a> in 2023, the most in the league during that span. Six of his 12 game-winning drives came this season.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
