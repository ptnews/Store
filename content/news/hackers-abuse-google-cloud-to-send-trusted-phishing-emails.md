<p>Cybercriminals have found a clever new way to get phishing emails straight into inboxes.</p><p>Instead of spoofing brands, they are abusing real cloud tools that people already trust. Security researchers say attackers recently hijacked a legitimate email feature inside <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud</a>. </p><p>The result was thousands of phishing messages that looked and felt like normal Google notifications. Many slipped past spam filters with ease.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/cybercrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tech tips</a>, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

This service allows businesses to send automated email notifications from workflows they build. Attackers exploited the Send Email task inside that system. Because the messages came from a real Google address, they appeared authentic to both users and security tools. </p><p>According to Check Point, a global cybersecurity firm that tracks and analyzes large-scale threat campaigns, the emails were sent from a legitimate Google-owned address and closely matched Google's notification style. Fonts, wording, and layout all looked familiar. Over a two-week period in December 2025, attackers sent more than 9,000 phishing emails targeting roughly 3,200 organizations across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/malicious-chrome-extensions-caught-stealing-sensitive-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA</strong></a></p><p>The messages looked like routine workplace alerts. Some claimed you had received a voicemail. Others said you were granted access to a shared document, like a Q4 file. That sense of normalcy lowered suspicion. Many people are used to seeing these exact messages every day. Even more concerning, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emails bypassed common protections</a> like SPF and DMARC because they were sent through Google-owned infrastructure. To email systems, nothing looked fake.</p><p>The attack did not stop at the email. Once a victim clicked the link, they were sent to a page hosted on storage.cloud.google.com. That added another layer of trust. From there, the link redirected again to googleusercontent.com. Next came a fake CAPTCHA or image check. This step blocked automated security scanners while letting real users continue. After passing that screen, victims landed on a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/new-scam-sends-fake-microsoft-365-login-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake Microsoft login page</a> hosted on a non-Microsoft domain. Any credentials entered there were captured by the attackers.</p><p>Check Point says the campaign focused heavily on industries that rely on automated alerts and shared documents. That included manufacturing, technology, finance, professional services, and retail. Other sectors like healthcare, education, government, energy, travel and media were also targeted. These environments see constant permission requests and file-sharing notices, which made the lures feel routine.</p><p>"We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration," a Google spokesperson told Cyberguy. "Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google’s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse."</p><p>The incident demonstrates how attackers can weaponize legitimate cloud automation tools without resorting to traditional spoofing.</p><p>Phishing emails are getting harder to spot, especially when attackers abuse real cloud platforms like Google Cloud. These steps help reduce risk when emails look familiar and legitimate.</p><p>Attackers rely on urgency. Messages about voicemails, shared files or permission changes are designed to make you click fast. Pause before taking action. Ask yourself whether you were actually expecting that alert. If not, verify it another way.</p><p>Always hover over links to preview the destination domain. In this campaign, links jumped across multiple trusted-looking Google domains before landing on a fake login page. If the final destination does not match the service asking you to sign in, close the page immediately.</p><p>Shared document alerts are a favorite lure because they feel routine at work. If an email claims you were granted access to a file you do not recognize, do not click directly from the message. Instead, open your browser and sign in to Google Drive or OneDrive manually to check for new files.</p><p>Password managers can be a strong last line of defense. They will not autofill credentials on fake Microsoft or Google login pages hosted on non-official domains. If your password manager refuses to fill in a login, that is a red flag worth paying attention to.</p><p>Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.</p><p>Check out the best expert-reviewed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">password managers</a> of 2025 at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/new-google-ai-makes-robots-smarter-without-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD</strong></a></p><p>Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. Many now detect malicious links, fake CAPTCHA pages, and credential harvesting sites in real time. Strong antivirus software can block phishing pages even after a click, which matters in multi-stage attacks like this one.</p><p>The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.</p><p>Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android &amp; iOS devices at <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p>Phishing campaigns often succeed because attackers already know your email, employer or role. That information is commonly pulled from data broker sites. A data removal service helps remove your personal information from these databases, making it harder for attackers to craft convincing, targeted emails.</p><p>While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.</p><p>Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><strong>Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: </strong><i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p>Even if attackers steal your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) can stop them from accessing your account. Use app-based authentication or hardware keys when possible, especially for work email, cloud storage, and Microsoft accounts.</p><p>If something feels off, report it. Flag suspicious Google or Microsoft alerts to your IT or security team so they can warn others. Early reporting can stop a phishing campaign before it spreads further inside an organization.</p><p>This campaign highlights a growing shift in phishing tactics. Attackers no longer need to fake brands when they can abuse trusted cloud services directly. As automation becomes more common, security awareness matters more than ever. Even familiar emails deserve a second look, especially when they push urgency or ask for credentials.</p><p>If a phishing email comes from a real Google address, how confident are you that you would spot it before clicking?
