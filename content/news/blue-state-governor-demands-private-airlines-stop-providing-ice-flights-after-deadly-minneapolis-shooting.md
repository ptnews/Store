<p>Massachusetts Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maura Healey</a> on Thursday demanded that two private airline companies stop providing flights for ICE to quickly remove illegal immigrants who have been detained, citing the recent ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis.</p><p>In a letter to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top executives</a> of GlobalX Airlines and Eastern Air Express, Healey criticized the companies for "sever[ing illegal immigrants] from their family, friends, community, and legal counsel without due process of law."</p><p>"They are hard-working, productive, and beloved members of our community who have been indiscriminately targeted for deportation proceedings," Healey wrote. "Some have been United States citizens. Some have been children. And as we have seen in our communities and, most recently, in Minnesota, ICE’s tactics are increasingly chaotic, brutal, and even deadly. This doesn’t make our communities safer — it, in fact, makes us all less safe."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-senate-candidate-mocked-after-claim-about-dismantling-ice-goes-viral-unmask-thugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>DEM SENATE CANDIDATE MOCKED AFTER CLAIM ABOUT DISMANTLING ICE GOES VIRAL: 'UNMASK THESE THUGS'</u></strong></a></p><p>Twin Cities resident Renee Nicole Good, 37, was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-involved-minnesota-shooting-vehicle-ramming-incident-dhs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot and killed</a> Wednesday by an ICE agent after she allegedly accelerated her car toward him during an immigration operation.</p><p>Healey also alleged the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration’s</a> use of private jets for ICE activity is costing taxpayers, while private airlines profit.</p><p>"On behalf of American taxpayers, I also find it incomprehensible that the Trump administration is choosing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on private jets to obstruct people’s due process at a time when they are denying hunger benefits, cutting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health care access</a>, and raising costs on everyone through costly tariffs," she wrote. </p><p>"This is not the justice we believe in or stand for in Massachusetts or as Americans.

It’s time for you to do the same," Healey wrote in the letter.</p><p>Healey's office, GlobalX Airlines and Eastern Air Express did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.</p>
