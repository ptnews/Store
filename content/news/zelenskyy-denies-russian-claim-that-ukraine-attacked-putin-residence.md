<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> pushed back Monday against claims by senior Kremlin officials that Kyiv attacked Russian President Vladimir Putin’s residence, calling the allegation a "complete fabrication."</p><p>Yuri Ushakov, a top foreign policy aide to Putin, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, made the claims in separate statements published on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s official Telegram channel, alleging Ukraine carried out a drone attack on a Russian presidential residence in the Novgorod region of northwestern Russia.</p><p>"This alleged ‘residence strike’ story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies. Furthermore, the Russians have already targeted Kyiv in the past, including the Cabinet of Ministers building," said Zelenskyy.</p><p>"Ukraine does not take steps that can undermine diplomacy. To the contrary, Russia always takes such steps. This is one of many differences between us."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-rejects-key-parts-us-peace-plan-kremlin-official-warns-europe-faces-new-war-risk-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PUTIN REJECTS KEY PARTS OF US PEACE PLAN AS KREMLIN OFFICIAL WARNS EUROPE FACES NEW WAR RISK: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>Lavrov warned that Russia <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would retaliate in another statement</a> published on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s official Telegram channel, saying "such reckless actions will not go unanswered."</p><p>"The targets for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retaliatory strikes</a> and the timing of their execution by the Russian Armed Forces have been determined.
