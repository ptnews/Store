<p>Clarinet player James Zimmermann is suing the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra over allegedly refusing to hire him over his past stance against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/dei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)</a>.</p><p>Zimmermann announced in a <a href="https://x.com/jameszimmermann/status/2008154467347103779" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">video on X</a> Monday that he filed the lawsuit several weeks ago after winning a blind audition for the Knoxville Symphony in September. He claimed that the CEO, Rachel Ford, informed him via email days later that he was no longer being considered.</p><p>"[B]ased on a number of items which have come to the attention of the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra regarding your employment with the Nashville Symphony, I regret to inform you that the KSO has decided not to move forward with offering you a contract of employment," the email reportedly read.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/harvard-alum-blasts-dei-policies-after-woke-values-drive-longtime-professors-exit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HARVARD ALUM BLASTS DEI POLICIES AFTER 'WOKE' VALUES DRIVE LONGTIME PROFESSOR'S EXIT</strong></a></p><p>He explained that he was the principal clarinet of the Nashville Symphony from 2008 until 2020, when he was "canceled" for resisting DEI policies within the orchestra. <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/how-racial-anxiety-conquered-an-orchestra-and-crushed-a-career/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Washington Free Beacon</a> previously reported on Zimmermann's termination in 2021 after he pushed back against efforts he said were promoting diversity over merit.</p><p>Zimmermann added that he is suing the orchestra for one year's salary plus $25k to compensate for time practicing ahead of the audition after learning that his position was going to what he described as an "obvious DEI hire who's still in college."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-tim-allen-criticize-dei-practices-hampering-creative-process-say-sitcoms-just-got-funny" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILL MAHER, TIM ALLEN CRITICIZE DEI PRACTICES HAMPERING CREATIVE PROCESS, SAY SITCOMS JUST 'GOT TO BE FUNNY'</strong></a></p><p>"I'm suing because these orchestras can't keep throwing out their best players to make room <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/21st-century-american-orchestras-struggle-for-diversity-and-relevance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for diversity hires</a> and putting race and politics above merit and skill," he said. "All this does is lower the quality of the music, alienate audiences and turn the arts into politics."</p><p>In a comment to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a>, Ford said that the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra expects to make a public announcement on the matter later this week.</p><p>Zimmermann reiterated his support for merit-based orchestra auditions to Fox News Digital and added that there is far more open support for fairness now than there was in 2020.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/melinda-gates-says-businesses-ending-dei-programs-affecting-families" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MELINDA GATES SAYS BUSINESSES ENDING DEI PROGRAMS ARE 'AFFECTING FAMILIES'</strong></a></p><p>"No question there's been more support in 2026 than there was in 2020. Six years ago, when the Nashville Symphony was being overtaken by DEI, I sounded the alarm, but it fell on deaf ears. My colleagues thought I was conspiratorial or downright crazy. It's different now though," Zimmermann said.</p><p>He added, "There are still detractors out there, but they're vastly outnumbered by people wanting to push back against the insanity of DEI. A blind audition is the most meritocratic system imaginable, and it's clear that people see Knoxville's refusal to hire me as an attack on meritocracy. You don't have to be a symphony aficionado to understand how outrageous this is."</p>
