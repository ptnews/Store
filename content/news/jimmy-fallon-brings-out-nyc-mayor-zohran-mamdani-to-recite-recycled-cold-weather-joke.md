<p>After taking heat for recycling the same joke about New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/zohran-mamdani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a>, late-night host Jimmy Fallon brought the mayor onstage to deliver the punchline himself during a surprise appearance.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fallon has faced criticism</a> since December for repeating the same "it’s so cold" joke about the new mayor during multiple episodes without acknowledging the reused punchline.</p><p>"It was so cold in New York City this morning, walking to work, I saw a Wall Street stockbroker spooning with Zohran Mamdani," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jimmy-fallon-keeps-telling-same-zohran-mamdani-joke-viewers-catching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fallon said for the first time Dec. 9,</a> going on to repeat some variation of the joke on at least two additional episodes of "The Tonight Show."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-calls-mamdani-straight-up-communist-warns-dems-lose-more-elections-deny" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILL MAHER CALLS MAMDANI A 'STRAIGHT-UP COMMUNIST,' WARNS DEMS WILL 'LOSE MORE ELECTIONS' IF THEY DENY IT</strong></a></p><p>During Monday’s taping, Mamdani leaned into the running gag, repeating the cold-weather punchline after a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mamdani-announces-remote-school-day-due-dangerous-winter-storm-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major winter storm</a> hit New York City.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/broadcast-bias-late-night-comedy-death-spiral-shows-how-leftist-hate-killed-humor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BROADCAST BIAS: LATE-NIGHT COMEDY DEATH SPIRAL SHOWS HOW LEFTIST HATE KILLED ITS HUMOR</strong></a></p><p>Fallon opened his monologue with more cold-weather jokes, saying at one point, "It's so cold, President Trump got a space heater installed in his MRI machine."</p><p>Mamdani then walked onto the stage to applause despite not being listed as a scheduled guest. NBC had promoted <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pete-davidson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pete Davidson</a>, Paris Hilton and Don Toliver ahead of the show.</p><p>"Jimmy, let me try one," said Mamdani. "It's so cold in New York City, the rent froze itself. … Good night everybody."</p><p>The joke referenced Mamdani’s push for a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/real-estate/rental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rent freeze</a>, a central promise of his winning mayoral bid. His campaign website continues to list a rent freeze as a top priority.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fcc-crack-down-liberal-late-night-shows-the-view-not-giving-equal-airtime-gop-guests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FCC TO CRACK DOWN ON LIBERAL LATE-NIGHT SHOWS, 'THE VIEW' FOR NOT GIVING EQUAL AIRTIME TO GOP GUESTS</strong></a></p><p>Before walking off, the mayor urged New Yorkers to take precautions amid the frigid temperatures, adding, "But seriously, stay inside. Stay warm. Stay safe."</p><p>Mamdani’s appearance came as New York City continued to assess the impact of the winter storm that battered the area over the weekend. City officials say it dumped more than a foot of snow in some areas and was <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/live-news/live-updates-millions-digging-out-thousands-without-power-as-next-winter-storm-threat-looms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked to at least 10 deaths</a>.</p><p>The mayor addressed the deaths during a news conference Tuesday, saying, "We don’t yet know whether every case will be ruled hypothermia. But we need every New Yorker to be on alert, looking out for their neighbors."</p>
