<p>Dan Campbell is going to keep it blunt with his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/detroit-lions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detroit Lions</a> — good or bad.</p><p>This year didn’t turn out how many believed it would for the Lions, and Campbell was asked during his end-of-season press conference how he would grade the 2025 campaign.</p><p>For a team that was a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/super-bowl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Bowl</a> favorite out of the NFC in the preseason, Campbell called it like it is for his team.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href="http://FOXNEWS.COM"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"Not good enough. We didn’t get in, we underachieved," he said, per Yahoo Sports. "So, not good. I’d give myself a freaking F."</p><p>The Lions were able to make it over .500, winning their Week 18 matchup against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/chicago-bears" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago Bears</a>, 19-16. But Campbell has always been a tough self critic as much as he is with his squad, so it’s not shocking to hear him grade himself so harshly.</p><p>But Campbell knows that this is the first time since 2022 that the Lions have missed the playoffs, and a 9-8 season isn’t the standard now for the franchise.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2026-nfl-draft-order-raiders-secure-no-1-pick-jets-hold-no-2-pick" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2026 NFL DRAFT ORDER: RAIDERS SECURE NO. 1 PICK, JETS HOLD NO. 2 PICK</strong></a></p><p>The Lions have had a slow build to one of the more formidable teams in the league, having gone 15-2 last year to earn the No. 1 seed in the NFC. They certainly fell short of expectations, though, being upset by rookie Jayden Daniels and the Washington Commanders at Ford Field in the Divisional Round.</p><p>Two years prior, the Lions made the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers after going 12-5. They would’ve made it to the team’s first-ever Super Bowl, too, if it wasn’t for a second-half collapse in the Bay Area that saw a miraculous 49ers comeback to earn a spot in the Big Game.</p><p>Campbell saw flux this past offseason on his coaching staff, with both of his top coordinators finding head coach jobs elsewhere.</p><p>The big one was Ben Johnson, the offensive whiz who unlocked Jared Goff and company, taking the Bears job in the NFC North. Johnson went from a strong ally to a bitter rival, and Chicago went on to win the division title in his first year.</p><p>Aaron Glenn, the Lions’ defensive coordinator under Campbell, didn’t have the same luck as Johnson, as his New York Jets went 3-14. Glenn, though, wasn’t among those axed during "Black Monday," as the Jets remain committed to him at least to start the 2026 season.</p><p>Campbell still can’t believe what happened after such a hot start to this season. The Lions went 4-1 to begin the year, but failed to find consistency after that.</p><p>A shocking Christmas Day loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 17 ended their playoffs hopes.</p><p>"It’s hard to believe that this is it," Campbell said. "It’s going to be a hard pill to swallow watching these teams in the playoffs. But I think you’ve got to watch them. You’ve got to force yourself to do it because that’s a drive to want to be there, be a part of it."</p><p>There’s no doubt Campbell will continue to trust his process and his team to get the job done, but he’ll have to wait until September to get a shot at checking off the playoff goal once again.</p><p>Campbell just completed his fifth season as head coach of the Lions. He owns a 53-43-1 record over 97 games.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
