After taking the ball on a full-court inbounds pass, he pushed past a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/virginia-tech-hokies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia Tech</a> defender and rose to take the shot.</p><p>Miller, who entered Wednesday’s contest averaging 20.8 points and 7.9 assists per game this season, capped his 24-point night with a 77-76 win in front of a roaring home crowd.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>SMU coach Andy Enfield spoke about the team's final play strategy. "Let's get the ball to Boopie and we rode with that," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJcq2M00A7w" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">he said</a> after the game.</p><p>Miller said he was confident the ball was going into the hoop immediately after it left his hand. "I missed too many free throws," he said. "So, I knew it was going in."</p><p>Miller's teammate, Samet Yigotoglu, also expressed confidence about where the buzzer-beating shot would land.

"Kurtis Shulz, our strength coach, put 10 pounds of muscle on him in the offseason, you saw how strong he was. All that muscle's gone right now. ... For him to be able to play 35 minutes is a credit to him. Just tells you who he is as a player, who he is as a person. He wanted to be out there."</p><p>SMU secured just its second win over an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/acc-nonconference-duke-unc-march" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACC opponent</a> on Wednesday.
