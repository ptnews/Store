<p>Longtime NFL head coach and Super Bowl champion Pete Carroll was fired after just one season with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/las-vegas-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Las Vegas Raiders</a>, the team announced Monday. </p><p>The 74-year-old coach said after Sunday’s win over the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas City Chiefs</a> that he "of course" would want to return for another season. But owner Mark Davis had different plans for the former Seattle Seahawks coach. </p><p>"The Las Vegas Raiders have relieved Pete Carroll of his duties as head coach. We appreciate and wish him and his family all the best," Davis said in a statement provided by the team. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"Moving forward, General Manager John Spytek will lead all football operations in close collaboration with Tom Brady, including the search for the club's next head coach. Together, they will guide football decisions with a shared focus on leadership, culture, and alignment with the organization's long-term vision and goals."</p><p>The move marks a period of instability for the Raiders organization as they begin their third straight year on the hunt for a new coach. </p><p>Carroll, who won the Super Bowl with then-Seahawks quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/russell-wilson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russell Wilson</a> in 2014, was brought in with the hopes of bringing that same playoff magic to the Raiders after the team dismissed Antonio Pierce. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/browns-fire-coach-kevin-stefanski" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>BROWNS FIRE HEAD COACH KEVIN STEFANSKI AFTER SIX SEASONS</u></strong></a></p><p>Pierce was also fired after just one season – he served as the interim head coach in 2023, after Josh McDaniels was fired midseason. </p><p>But Carroll wasn’t able to live up to those expectations.  </p><p>The Raiders went on a 10-game losing streak, Geno Smith finished with a league-high 17 interceptions and for the second season, the Raiders finished at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AFC West</a> with a 3-14 record.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Carroll was animated after the team closed out the season with a 14-12 win over the Chiefs, but was immediately met in his postgame presser with questions about wanting to come back the following season and reports of retirement. </p><p>"Nobody’s talking to me about that," he dismissed at the time.</p><p> <i>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
