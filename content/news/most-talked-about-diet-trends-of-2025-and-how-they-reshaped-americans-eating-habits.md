<p>From <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/viral-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viral food videos</a> to heated nutrition debates and the rise of weight-loss drugs, a number of forces in 2025 reshaped how Americans eat.</p><p>More people turned to influencers for food advice, plus medications like Ozempic and Wegovy became mainstream — all shifting our eating habits in one way or another.</p><p>The year's biggest diet trends ranged from time-tested plans like the Mediterranean diet to more controversial approaches such as carnivore eating.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/beantok-trend-goes-viral-wild-gut-health-promises-heres-what-experts-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>'BEANTOK' TREND GOES VIRAL WITH WILD GUT HEALTH PROMISES — HERE'S WHAT EXPERTS SAY</u></strong></a></p><p>Whether any of these diets are right for you depends, of course, on your own health particulars as well as the wisest medical guidance. </p><p>Fox News Digital spoke with experts to break down the facts behind 2025's top <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diet trends.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/cuisines/mediterranean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mediterranean diet</a> remained popular in 2025.</p><p>Modeled after eating patterns in countries like Italy, Spain and Greece, the program emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, olive oil, lean proteins <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/cuisines/seafood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and fish.</a> Its benefits include improved heart health, reduced inflammation and sustainable weight management.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/olive-oil-shot-craze-explodes-online-doctor-warns-more-hype-than-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>OLIVE OIL SHOT CRAZE EXPLODES ONLINE, BUT DOCTOR WARNS IT'S 'MORE HYPE THAN MEDICINE'</u></strong></a></p><p>Dr. Shad Marvasti, an Arizona-based family and integrative medicine physician and author of "Longevity Made Simple: Live Healthier for Longer with the DRESS Code," said the diet can lower the risk of cardiovascular and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alzheimer's diseases.</a></p><p>"Overall, it's not a diet as much as a long-term lifestyle that supports longevity and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart health,"</a> Marvasti told Fox News Digital, though he cautioned that portion control still matters.</p><p>"Olive oil, nuts and whole grains are healthy yet calorie dense, so overeating may limit weight-loss goals if portions aren't balanced."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/keto-diet-has-surprising-impact-mental-health-researchers-discover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ketogenic diet</a> — high in fat, moderate in protein and extremely low in carbohydrates — continued to attract followers in 2025.</p><p>Originally developed to treat epilepsy, keto forces the body to burn fat for fuel by limiting carbs to about 5–10% of daily calories. Fat typically accounts for 70–80% of intake.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/protein-packed-cheese-trend-has-fitness-fans-ditching-bars-experts-say-its-best-go-easy"><strong><u>PROTEIN-PACKED CHEESE TREND HAS FITNESS FANS DITCHING BARS, BUT EXPERTS SAY IT'S BEST TO GO EASY</u></strong></a></p><p>Jessica Mack, a New York-based wellness expert and former occupational therapist, said keto can help with blood sugar control and appetite suppression — but comes with drawbacks.</p><p>"The diet is highly restrictive and difficult to sustain long-term," Mack told Fox News Digital. "Many people experience early side effects such as fatigue, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management/headaches-and-migraines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headaches, constipation</a> and electrolyte imbalances, often referred to as the 'keto flu.'"</p><p>Poorly planned keto diets can also lack fiber and key nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium and potassium.</p><p>A healthier approach, Mack said, prioritizes unsaturated fats <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/benefits-olive-oil" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as olive oil</a>, avocados, nuts and seeds instead of processed meats and butter. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Overall, keto may work short-term for some people, but it's not "inherently superior" to balanced eating plans, Mack said.</p><p>Weight-loss drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) have reshaped how many Americans eat.</p><p>Because these medications slow digestion and suppress appetite, patients are often advised to avoid fried foods, sugary drinks and heavily processed snacks. </p><p>Instead, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/ozempic-users-can-barely-finish-third-restaurant-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GLP-1-friendly eating</a> focuses on protein, non-starchy vegetables and smaller portions.</p><p>Marvasti told Fox News Digital that GLP-1 patients should avoid heavy cream sauces and greasy meats, as those can worsen nausea and reflux. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>Carbonated drinks may increase bloating, while <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/meals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large meals</a> can cause discomfort, he added.</p><p>"Low-protein diets can accelerate muscle loss, especially during rapid weight loss, so getting enough protein is essential," he said, emphasizing that "small portions, steady protein and fewer ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are key."</p><p>A general guideline, Marvasti said, is to fill half the plate with vegetables — plus one-quarter with lean protein and one-quarter with whole grains and a small amount of healthy fat.</p><p>Protein took center stage in 2025, with Americans loading up on lean meats, protein shakes, tofu, tempeh, Greek yogurt and cottage cheese.</p><p>Unlike keto or GLP-1-related diets, high-protein eating doesn't eliminate carbs, though increased protein intake often <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/stop-carb-overload-experts-expose-hidden-reason-big-meals-backfire-how-protein-flips-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces appetite overall.</a></p><p>Protein supports muscle preservation, metabolism and satiety, Mack said — but warned it's become "a buzzword instead of a strategy."</p><p>"The problem isn't protein itself, but the misconception that more is always better," she said. "When protein crowds out fiber, gut health and cholesterol are usually the first to suffer." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>Excessive protein at the expense of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, Mack said, "can undermine long-term health, even if it initially supports <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight loss."</a></p><p>A more sustainable approach is a protein-forward diet that prioritizes balance, quality and individual needs "rather than extremes," she said. </p><p>The most controversial diet trend of 2025 was the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/8-carnivore-diet-myths-debunked-researcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carnivore diet.</a></p><p>This approach eliminates plant foods entirely, focusing on meat, fish, eggs, animal fats and occasional dairy. </p><p>Fruits, vegetables, grains and sweets are off-limits.</p><p>The diet, Mack said, "eliminates fiber-rich foods that play a key role in gut health, hormone balance and cholesterol regulation," resulting in rapid weight loss — largely because people stop eating UPFs.</p><p>Over time, cutting out plant foods may create new health risks, especially for people with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digestive issues</a> or cardiovascular concerns, she said.</p>
