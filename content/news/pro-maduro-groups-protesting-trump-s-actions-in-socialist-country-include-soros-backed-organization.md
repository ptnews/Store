<p>One of the groups organizing protests against President Donald Trump’s capture of Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro is a group funded by the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/george-soros" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Soros</a>-linked Open Society Foundation.</p><p>Trump’s invasion of Venezuela’s capital city, Caracas, and subsequent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/from-palace-prison-venezuelan-strongman-maduro-locked-troubled-brooklyn-jail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrest of Maduro</a> and his wife, Cilia Flores, on Saturday drew quick condemnation from a handful of groups, including some calling themselves the No War on Venezuela Coalition.</p><p>In a flyer posted by the Soros-funded Alliance for Global Justice (AFGJ), the coalition called for global protests at U.S. embassies, military bases, city halls and other sites to "defend <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuelan sovereignty</a> and right to resist."</p><p>The AFGJ flyer stated, "We, the undersigned anti-imperialist and anti-war organizations, condemn the U.S. violent attacks on the rights of Venezuelans, and violations of Venezuela’s sovereignty."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/second-front-how-socialist-cell-us-mobilized-pro-maduro-foot-soldiers-within-12-hours" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SECOND FRONT: HOW A SOCIALIST CELL IN THE US MOBILIZED PRO-MADURO FOOT SOLDIERS WITHIN 12 HOURS</strong></a></p><p>The coalition urged "mass resistance" against the administration’s actions, telling people to "take to the streets, organize rallies and teach-ins on your university campuses, mobilize in your unions to demonstrate solidarity and shut down the supply chains of imperialism, including resolutions, pickets and protests outside of arms factories and ports that are providing the weapons for this aggression."</p><p>It especially urged those outside the U.S. to target "U.S. embassies, U.S. military bases and diplomatic installations around the world."</p><p>According to the website of the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic network founded by Soros and led by his son, Alex Soros, the group donated $250,000 to AFGJ in 2020.</p><p>The description listed for the donation on the website was "to catalyze Black communities into the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global movement for climate justice</a>."</p><p>AFGJ has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration. In a statement Tuesday, the group wrote that the "War against Venezuela is against Us All."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maduros-wife-suffered-significant-injuries-dramatic-capture-attorney-alleges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MADURO'S WIFE SUFFERED 'SIGNIFICANT INJURIES' IN DRAMATIC CAPTURE, ATTORNEY ALLEGES</strong></a></p><p>In the statement, AFGJ drew a line between the administration’s actions in Venezuela and its deployment of National Guard troops to major U.S. cities "occupying our streets as part of a hemispheric repression of resistance."</p><p>"In his first press conference following the January 3 invasion, Trump specifically referenced <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington, D.C.</a>, Memphis, and other U.S. cities that have been occupied by federal troops. He knows full well that these are connected," AFGJ continued.</p><p>"People of color, immigrants, all those who resist are designated as internal enemies, and international solidarity movements are targets of the hybrid war.</p><p>"The strategies of war and repression against Venezuela are united in a single strategy, not only toward other nations, but here at home. Memphis or Caracas — to the Pentagon, we’re all the same."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately receive a response.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/maduros-son-gives-unconditional-support-newly-sworn-interim-venezuela-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MADURO'S SON GIVES 'UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT' TO NEWLY SWORN IN INTERIM VENEZUELA PRESIDENT</strong></a></p><p>Following months of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/caribbean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean</a>, Trump authorized a military strike on Caracas that resulted in Maduro and his wife being apprehended and transported to New York City to stand trial.</p><p>Maduro and his wife have since been charged in U.S. federal court with conspiracy to traffic large quantities of cocaine into the country and related crimes, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/narco-terror" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including narco-terrorism</a> and weapons offenses. Both have pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><p>Fox News Digital also reached out to AFGJ and the Open Society Foundations for comment but did not immediately receive a response.</p>
