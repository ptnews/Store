"It's a weird thing."</p><p>Damon went on to say that he made a key change to his diet that helped him shed the pounds.</p><p> "I literally, just because of this other thing I did with my doctor, stopped eating gluten," he said.

I would imagine what that feels like for you guys – when you’re preparing," Damon said. "It’s like just part of your day. It’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of your job</a>, right? It’s like you get really routinized about it and kind of build your day around all that stuff."</p><p>"That’s kind of the physical side of getting ready," he added. </p><p>Damon also told Jason and Travis, 36, that he has continued to maintain a gluten-free diet after completing production on "The Odyssey."</p><p>"I'm done," he said. "I'm gluten-free everything."</p><p>"I found a gluten-free beer," Damon said with a laugh. "It's been so long since I've had gluten, I can't tell if it's good or not. So, that's a good sign."</p><p>"It's working. It's working," Jason told him.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>Damon has previously opened up about drastically transforming his body for roles.
