<p>Remembering to take medication sounds simple. However, missed doses put people at serious health risk every day. Because of that, engineers at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/mit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a> have designed a pill that confirms when someone swallows it. As a result, doctors could track treatment more accurately, and patients could stay on schedule more easily. At the same time, the pill safely breaks down inside the body, which helps reduce long-term risk.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong></p><p>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

It uses a tiny, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/medical-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biodegradable radio-frequency antenna</a> made from zinc and cellulose. These materials already have strong safety records in medicine. Here is what happens step by step:</p><p>This entire process happens within about 10 minutes. An external receiver, potentially built into a wearable device, detects the signal from up to two feet away.</p><p>Previous smart pill designs relied on components that stayed intact as they passed through the digestive system. That raised concerns about long-term safety. The MIT team took a different approach. Nearly all parts of the antenna break down in the stomach within days. Only a tiny off-the-shelf RF chip remains, and it passes naturally through the body. According to lead researcher Mehmet Girayhan Say, the goal is clear. The system avoids long-term buildup while still reliably confirming that a pill was taken.</p><p>This smart pill is not meant for every prescription. Instead, it targets situations where missing medication can be dangerous. Potential beneficiaries include:</p><p>For these patients, adherence can mean the difference between recovery and serious complications.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/breakthrough-device-promises-detect-glucose-without-needles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BREAKTHROUGH DEVICE PROMISES TO DETECT GLUCOSE WITHOUT NEEDLES</strong></a></p><p>Senior author Giovanni Traverso emphasizes that the focus is on patient health. The aim is to support people, not police them. The research team published its findings in Nature Communications and plans further preclinical testing. Human trials are expected next as the technology moves closer to real-world use. This research received funding from Novo Nordisk, MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham and Women's Hospital Division of Gastroenterology and the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.</p><p>Patients failing to take medicine as prescribed contribute to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths each year. It also adds billions of dollars to health care costs. This problem hits hardest when patients must take treatment consistently over long periods. That includes people who have received organ transplants, patients with tuberculosis and those managing complex neurological conditions. For these groups, missing doses can have life-altering consequences.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/10-health-tech-products-stealing-spotlight-ces-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>10 HEALTH TECH PRODUCTS STEALING THE SPOTLIGHT AT CES 2026</u></strong></a></p><p>If you or a loved one relies on critical medication, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/smart-and-safe-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this kind of technology</a> could add an extra layer of safety. It may reduce guesswork for doctors and ease pressure on patients who manage complex treatment plans.
