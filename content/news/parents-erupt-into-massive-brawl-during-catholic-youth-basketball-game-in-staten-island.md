<p>Footage has captured the disastrous moment when multiple parents erupted into a massive fight during a Catholic youth basketball game last month in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staten Island, New York</a>. </p><p>The violent courtside brawl unfolded on Dec. 20 at St. Teresa in Castleton Corners during a 6th grade boys game between the school and Saint Clare, <a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2026/01/weeks-after-melee-staten-island-officials-announce-new-rules-for-spectators-at-youth-basketball-games.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to SILive</a>. It was monitored by the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO), which oversees the parish-based sport. </p><p>Video obtained by the Staten Island Advance initially shows <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two moms</a> locked in a heated exchange that quickly escalated. Tensions boiled over when one shoved the other, sparking a furious exchange of chaotic punches.  </p><p>Spectators, other parents and school staff then rushed to the scene in an attempt to separate the two mothers, who had begun clutching each other by the hair, with one landing a relentless barrage of punches at the other’s head.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/christmas-brawl-erupts-wealthy-massachusetts-enclave-during-holiday-celebration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CHRISTMAS BRAWL ERUPTS IN WEALTHY MASSACHUSETTS ENCLAVE DURING HOLIDAY CELEBRATION</strong></a></p><p>After several men finally pulled the two women apart, a separate fight erupted during the disruptive melee, the video shows. Chaos reignited as the women returned to each other, continuing their violent struggle amid the ongoing turmoil.</p><p>According to CYO County Director Michael Neely, the two women were parents, and some of those who became involved in the altercation were their family members, SILive reported.</p><p>Neely added that the two women, along with the family members who became involved, have been suspended indefinitely from attending CYO games.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/high-school-football-team-travels-500-miles-pepper-sprayed-after-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM TRAVELS 500 MILES ONLY TO GET PEPPER SPRAYED BY POLICE AFTER LOSS</strong></a></p><p>"Two families got involved and, in the end, their families have been banned from CYO indefinitely," Neely said.</p><p>Until now, leaders reportedly said altercations at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catholic Youth Organization games</a> are typically handled on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>However, the fight has prompted officials, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Staten Island Borough President</a> Vito Fossella and CYO, to announce new rules on Tuesday aimed at preventing spectators from acting out of bounds.</p><p>Spectators ejected by a referee for disruptive behavior at a CYO basketball game will now face a one-year ban.</p><p>"The mission was about the kids," Fossella, whose children reportedly played CYO basketball, said during a press conference. "The mission was about teaching them responsibility. The mission was about them having a good time: the kids. The kids are the center of this universe here. And every once in a while some spectators get out of control and ruin it for the kids and ruin it for everybody else."</p>
