<p>Cam Little is apparently looking to do a total makeover of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL record books</a>.</p><p>Just two months ago, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacksonville Jaguars kicker</a> nailed a 68-yard field goal for the longest in NFL history. Now, he owns the two longest makes after drilling a 67-yarder on Sunday.</p><p>As time expired in the first half against the Tennessee Titans, the Jags’ field goal unit came on to make a blowout game even more lopsided.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>Little lined up his kick, and it hooked left at the perfect time to make it a 31-7 lead for Jacksonville - and exciting "six-seven" fans everywhere.</p><p>The crowd went berserk, but Little was calm, cool and collected, considering this is now the apparent norm for him. He did bust out a celebration afterward, though.</p><p>Little’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/jaguars-kicker-breaks-nfl-record-longest-made-field-goal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking kick came</a> on Nov. 2 against the Las Vegas Raiders, when he trumped former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, who hit a 66-yard field goal to help the Ravens win over the Detroit Lions in September 2021.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/looking-back-sports-gambling-controversies-throughout-2025-nba-mlb-investigations-leading-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LOOKING BACK AT THE SPORTS GAMBLING CONTROVERSIES THROUGHOUT 2025, WITH NBA AND MLB INVESTIGATIONS LEADING WAY</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tampa-bay-buccaneers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> kicker Chase McLaughlin hit a 65-yard field goal against the Philadelphia Eagles earlier this season, which tied Dallas Cowboys kicker Brandon Aubrey for second-longest all-time at the time. Aubrey also hit a 64-yarder against the New York Giants this season.</p><p>Little is no stranger to kicking long field goals. He wowed NFL fans when he hit a 70-yard field goal in the preseason and was practicing from long distances in the thin air of Denver a couple of weeks ago. Eight kickers have attempted 70-yarders in the regular season, and all of them failed.</p><p>Little’s leg will surely be an important key to the Jaguars’ Super Bowl hopes. Assuming they hold on against Tennessee, the Jaguars would get the No. 1 seed if both the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denver Broncos</a> and New England Patriots lose.</p><p><i>Fox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
