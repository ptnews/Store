<p>Ahead of the "MELANIA" film’s global launch, first lady Melania Trump hosted a private screening at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> for guests on Saturday.</p><p>Mrs. Trump's exclusive senior advisor and agent Marc Beckman, who structured the deal on behalf of the first lady with Amazon MGM Studios, told Fox News Digital on Monday the screening was for people connected to the film, as well as people connected to her career in different ways.</p><p>Beckman, also a producer of the film, shared that the assembled guests were "cultural iconoclasts."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/trumps-celebrate-21st-wedding-anniversary-president-returns-from-davos"><strong>TRUMPS TO CELEBRATE 21ST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY AS PRESIDENT RETURNS FROM DAVOS</strong></a></p><p><strong>"</strong>They were people from all walks of life, people from design, people from sports," said Beckman. "We had royalty, people from business, like big tech CEOs, as well as finance and beyond. So it was really such an interesting group of people that were assembled — all reflective of her personality and her brand."</p><p>Beckman said the guests each had various moments in the film that were their favorites — reflecting their own passions. </p><p>"For example, [those in] the creative industries tended to love the fashion components. [Those] who were more conservative minded, they loved those special moments when the president was behind the scenes."</p><p>He added, "We're releasing it in movie theaters to give a very rich stylized cinematic experience that has an incredible sonic component to it. And it's very unique in that way."</p><p>The 104-minute film shares the first lady's life leading up to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/inauguration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Donald Trump's inauguration</a> as 47th president — from her home in Trump Tower in New York City to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, plus behind-the-scenes access at the White House.</p><p>Photos from the event show custom white popcorn boxes labeled "MELANIA," along with branded cookies. Guests were also gifted copies of her memoir.</p><p>President Trump, along with the couple's son Barron, sat with guests who included <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeff-bezos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Bezos</a>, Erika Kirk, Prince and Princes of Saudi Arabia, designer Peter Arnell, Mike Tyson, Tim Cook, Tony Robbins and many other big names, sources familiar confirmed. </p><p>Among the guests was conservative influencer Link Lauren. "It’s not a documentary; it’s a film that takes you on a cinematic journey. I’ve heard from many women saying they have no date for the ‘MELANIA’ film," Lauren posted on X.</p><p>"It’s a celebration of our country and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/america-together" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an American story</a>," he added. "Due to media bias, so many lies have been told about our first lady. She’s the most talked about woman on Earth."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>He went on, "But there’s nothing more powerful than speaking your own truth. Go see the film, regardless of your politics or preconceived notions of who first lady <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/melania-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melania Trump</a> is. You will not regret it."</p><p>The first lady shared a photo on X of the screening in the East Room, writing that she was "deeply humbled to have been surrounded by an inspiring room of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/family-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friends, family</a> and cultural iconoclasts at the White House last night."</p><p>She continued, "Each of these individuals each brought their unique vision to the world, making a lasting impression. Our personal stories endure time and serve as a reminder of our mutual obligation to one another."</p><p>The "MELANIA" premiere is set for Friday.</p><p>President Trump promoted the film in a post on X, writing: "'MELANIA, the Movie<i>,'</i> is a MUST-WATCH.
