Monique and McKee kept most of their personal assets, including bank accounts, and split personal property to their "mutual satisfaction," the records show. McKee kept possession of the house, which was in his name.</p><p><strong>2005 to 2009:</strong> Undergraduate student at Ohio State University.</p><p><strong>2009 to 2014:</strong> Studied to earn his medical degree at Ohio State University.</p><p><strong>2014 to 2015:</strong> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General surgery internship</a> at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.</p><p><strong>2015 to 2020:</strong> General surgery internship at Virginia Tech Carilion Clinic.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chilling-surveillance-video-shows-person-interest-unsolved-ohio-dentist-murder-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EERIE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS 'PERSON OF INTEREST' IN UNSOLVED OHIO DENTIST MURDER CASE</strong></a></p><p><strong>2020 to 2022:</strong> Vascular surgery fellowship at University of Maryland Medical Center.</p><p><strong>2022 to 2025: </strong>Was licensed in several states, including California, Nevada and Illinois.
