<p>Foods that Americans were advised to avoid for decades are back on shopping lists — following updated federal dietary guidance released under President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> administration.</p><p>After years of being told to avoid <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-fat dairy, red meat</a> and saturated fats like butter and beef tallow, the White House said updated guidance no longer broadly discourages those foods when consumed in moderation.</p><p>The changes reflect revisions to federal nutrition recommendations developed through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), rather than a wholesale reversal of prior advice.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/healthiest-red-meats-eat-how-cardiologist-says-prepare-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HEALTHIEST RED MEATS TO EAT — AND HOW A CARDIOLOGIST SAYS TO PREPARE THEM</strong></a></p><p>It doesn't mean that every fatty food is encouraged. For example, experts still caution against eating too many processed snacks that are high in saturated fat such as chips, cookies and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/dessert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ice cream.</a></p><p>HHS Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/robert-f-kennedy-jr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> said he was "ending the war on saturated fats" — though the updated report continues to recommend limits on daily intake.</p><p>"Protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines," he said.</p><p>Here's a handy summary of which foods are back — and how federal guidance and nutrition experts say they should be consumed.</p><p>The new 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans describe <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-fat milk</a> and yogurt as "healthy fats."</p><p>"In general, saturated fat consumption should not exceed 10% of total daily calories," the report states. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/red-meat-can-help-mood-part-healthy-balanced-diet-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>RED MEAT CAN HELP YOUR MOOD IF PART OF A HEALTHY, BALANCED DIET, STUDY SUGGESTS</u></strong></a></p><p>"Significantly limiting highly processed foods will help meet this goal. More high-quality research is needed to determine which types of dietary fats best support <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term health."</a></p><p>Full-fat dairy is packed with fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A, D, E and K, which "allows for better transportation and absorption," said Amy Goldsmith, a Maryland-based registered dietitian and owner of Kindred Nutrition. </p><p>"There can also be an increased satiation from the products, as the fat will decrease [the hormone] ghrelin," she told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Goldsmith noted saturated fat should still be portioned, even if not completely cut out. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/red-meat-back-jillian-michaels-breaks-down-saturated-fat-new-food-pyramid"><strong><u>IS RED MEAT BACK? JILLIAN MICHAELS BREAKS DOWN SATURATED FAT AND THE NEW FOOD PYRAMID</u></strong></a></p><p>"This is the nuance with the new dietary guidelines," she said. "As dietitians, we want to ensure this visualization [doesn't lead] to an increase in saturated fat, as it could contribute to an increase in chronic disease."</p><p>There's usually less added sugar in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/greek-yogurt-amazing-benefits-body-workouts-new-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-fat products,</a> she noted, but they still need to be portioned out to avoid the consumption of too much saturated fat and total calories.</p><p>The Trump administration's new report lists butter as one of several fats that may be used <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/healthy-cooking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in cooking,</a> while prioritizing unsaturated oils.</p><p>"When cooking with or adding fats to meals, prioritize oils with essential fatty acids, such as olive oil," according to the guidelines. "Other options can include butter or beef tallow."</p><p>Goldsmith said butter is a great source of vitamin A, which is "essential for vision and immune health."</p><p>It also has vitamin E, an antioxidant, and vitamin K2 — which "ensures calcium is used to strengthen bones and teeth."</p><p>"It also is the best source of butyric acid, which serves as an anti-inflammatory," Goldsmith said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Most butters are 60–70% saturated fat … so it will be difficult to keep total saturated fat intake within recommended limits if portion and volume aren't taken into consideration," she added. </p><p>"In addition, if someone already has a high LDL cholesterol, butter would not be the best source of spread as it can continue to contribute to increasing LDL."</p><p>Beef tallow is high in vitamin A, D, E and K, similar to other animal-based fats.</p><p>Goldsmith also noted that 40–50% of beef tallow is monounsaturated fat, a proportion comparable to some plant-based oils.</p><p>"The other 50% is saturated fat, however. So once again, serving size and volume need to be considered to keep saturated fat below 10% of total calories," she said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"In addition, beef tallow can be more expensive than butter and difficult to get."</p><p>The new report recommends "[consuming] a variety of protein foods from animal sources, including eggs, poultry, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/cuisines/seafood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seafood and</a> red meat, as well as a variety of plant-sourced protein foods, including beans, peas, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds and so."</p><p>Goldsmith noted that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/cuisines/steak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red meat</a> contains all nine of the essential amino acids that can't be produced by the human body alone.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"About 60% of the iron in meat is heme iron, and it's one of the best sources of zinc," she said. </p><p>"Heme iron is absorbed into the gut fast, which means it can rapidly restore ferritin, your iron stores." </p><p>Red meat's zinc is also crucial for immune cells and inflammation control.</p><p>"The new dietary guidelines stuck with the recommendation to keep saturated fat below 10% and, on average, red meat is 40–45% saturated fat," Goldsmith said.</p><p>"It will be important to vary animal protein to keep the saturated fat number down as high saturated fat diets contribute to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart disease</a> and cancers."</p>
