<p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</a> are the next team off the head coach search board, and they're going with someone experienced in that department in the NFL. </p><p>Robert Saleh, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco 49ers</a>' star defensive coordinator, are working to finalize a deal with the Titans to make him their next head coach, according to multiple reports.</p><p>Saleh couldn’t get things turned around with the New York Jets in his 56 career games with the franchise from 2021-24, but the Titans are ready to give him another crack at molding a young roster centered around the 2025 No. 1 overall pick, quarterback Cam Ward.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href="http://FOXNEWS.COM"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Saleh marks the fourth head coaching hire in this wild NFL cycle. And the three previous hires — John Harbaugh (New York Giants), Kevin Stefanski (Atlanta Falcons) and Jeff Hafley (Miami Dolphins) — were all on the Titans’ interview schedule before being scooped up elsewhere.</p><p>The Titans announced Saleh and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas City Chiefs</a> offensive coordinator Matt Nagy had in-person interviews on Monday, and it’s clear now the 49ers coach said all the right things to make ownership believe he’s the best hire.</p><p>Tennessee wasn’t waiting any longer, and they pulled the trigger on Saleh, a defensive whiz with a leader-of-men personality that has shined through in his vast experience as a coach in the league.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dolphins-hire-jeff-hafley-ex-packers-defensive-coordinator-next-head-coach-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DOLPHINS HIRE JEFF HAFLEY, EX-PACKERS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, AS NEXT HEAD COACH: REPORTS</strong></a></p><p>Saleh started entering the head coach conversation when he got his shot as defensive coordinator under 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan in 2017. The 49ers developed into a great team by the 2019 campaign, where Saleh’s defense played a vital role in a trip to the Super Bowl. They would ultimately lose to the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>After a 6-10 season in San Fran the following year, the Jets made Saleh their next head coach, where his motto, "All Gas, No Brakes" became a sticking point for everyone in Florham Park.</p><p>But, while the Jets’ defense became one of the best units in the sport under Saleh’s tutelage, they were never able to break their postseason drought.</p><p>The Jets’ best record under Saleh was 7-10, which came in back-to-back seasons in 2022 and 2023. Then, after just five games in 2024, where the Jets went 2-3, owner Woody Johnson made the call to fire Saleh and promote defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich to interim head coach.</p><p>Shanahan came calling for Saleh to take back his role in the Bay Area, and he was dealt a tough hand with key players Fred Warner and Nick Bosa, among others, being lost for the season due to injury.</p><p>However, a young 49ers defense was coached up by Saleh and the rest of the staff to produce a unit that took off in the second half. The 49ers finished 13th in points allowed per game (21.8), proving to be a group on the rise as they made their way to the playoffs.</p><p>Their best win came in the Wild Card Round, going into Philadelphia and taking down the reigning Super Bowl-champion Eagles to move on. Unfortunately, the Seattle Seahawks were too much for the 49ers, blowing them out 41-6 this past Saturday to end their season.</p><p>Just two days later, Saleh is moving to "Music City," where he faces a similar situation he saw in New York — a team desperate to turn things around sooner than later.</p><p>Tennessee has gone 3-14 in each of the last two seasons. But they have the No. 4 overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft and nine total picks in April.</p><p>Also, the Titans have a whopping <a href="https://overthecap.com/salary-cap/tennessee-titans#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$93.5 million in cap space</a> to spend in free agency, where GM Mike Borgonzi can be aggressive to bolster Saleh’s roster for competition in what is an improving AFC South conference.</p><p>This is the third job Saleh has had in the AFC South, having coached the Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars in the past. He was with the Jags from 2014-16 as the team’s linebackers coach before joining Shanahan in San Francisco.</p><p>As for the NFL head coaching search, another team was added on Monday, with the surprising firing of Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott.</p><p>With four spots filled, six remain in the Bills, Cleveland Browns, Las Vegas Raiders, Baltimore Ravens, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Arizona Cardinals.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
