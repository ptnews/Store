<p>Online shopping feels familiar and fast, but a hidden threat continues to operate behind the scenes. </p><p>Researchers are tracking a long-running <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/cybercrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web skimming campaign</a> that targets businesses connected to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major payment networks</a>. Web skimming is a technique where criminals secretly add malicious code to checkout pages so they can steal payment details as shoppers type them in. </p><p>These attacks work quietly inside the browser and often leave no obvious signs. Most victims only discover the problem after unauthorized charges appear on their statements.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

These attacks focus on online stores where shoppers enter payment details during checkout. Instead of hacking banks or card networks directly, attackers slip malicious code into a store's checkout page. That code is written in JavaScript, which is a common type of website code used to make pages interactive. Legitimate sites use it for things like forms, buttons and payment processing.</p><p>In Magecart attacks, criminals abuse that same code to secretly copy card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and billing details as shoppers type them in. The checkout still works, and the purchase goes through, so there is no obvious warning sign. Magecart originally described attacks against Magento-based online stores. Today, the term applies to web-skimming campaigns across many e-commerce platforms and payment systems.</p><p>Researchers say this campaign targets merchants tied to several major payment networks, including:</p><p>Large enterprises that rely on these payment providers face a higher risk due to complex websites and third-party integrations.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/700credit-data-breach-exposes-ssns-5-8m-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>700CREDIT DATA BREACH EXPOSES SSNS OF 5.8M CONSUMERS</strong></a></p><p>Attackers usually enter through weak points that are easy to overlook. Common entry paths include vulnerable third-party scripts, outdated plugins and unpatched content management systems. Once inside, they inject JavaScript directly into the checkout flow. The skimmer monitors form fields tied to card data and personal details, then quietly sends that information to attacker-controlled servers.</p><p>To avoid detection, the malicious JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. Some versions can remove themselves when they detect an admin session, which makes inspections appear clean. Researchers also found the campaign uses bulletproof hosting. These hosting providers ignore abuse reports and takedown requests, giving attackers a stable environment to operate. Because web skimmers run inside the browser, they can bypass many server-side fraud controls used by merchants and payment providers.</p><p>Magecart campaigns impact three groups at the same time:</p><p>This shared exposure makes detection slower and response more difficult.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/new-malware-can-read-your-chats-steal-your-money" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY</strong></a></p><p>While shoppers cannot fix compromised checkout pages, a few smart habits can reduce exposure, limit how stolen data is used, and help catch fraud faster.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual and single-use cards</a> are digital card numbers that link to your real credit or debit account without exposing the actual number. They work like a normal card at checkout, but add an extra layer of protection. Most people already have access to them through services they use every day, including:</p><p>Major banks and credit card issuers that offer virtual card numbers inside their apps</p><p>Mobile wallet apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay generate temporary card numbers for online purchases, keeping your real card number hidden.</p><p>Some payment apps and browser tools that create one-time or merchant-locked card numbers</p><p>A single-use card typically works for one purchase or expires shortly after use. A virtual card can stay active for one store and be paused or deleted later. If a web skimming attack captures one of these numbers, attackers usually cannot reuse it elsewhere or run up repeat charges, which limits financial damage and makes fraud easier to stop.</p><p>Transaction alerts notify you the moment your card is used, even for small purchases. If web skimming leads to fraud, these alerts can expose unauthorized charges quickly and give you a chance to freeze the card before losses grow. For example, a $2 test charge on your card can signal fraud before larger purchases appear.</p><p>Use strong, unique passwords for banking and card portals to reduce the risk of account takeover. A password manager helps generate and store them securely.</p><p>Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.</p><p>Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at <i><strong>Cyberguy.com.</strong></i></p><p>Strong antivirus software can block connections to malicious domains used to collect skimmed data and warn you about unsafe websites.</p><p>The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.
