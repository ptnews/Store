<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> called for defense spending to be raised to $1.5 trillion, a 50% increase over the current budget. </p><p>"After long and difficult negotiations with Senators, Congressmen, Secretaries, and other Political Representatives, I have determined that, for the Good of our Country, especially in these very troubled and dangerous times, our Military Budget for the year 2027 should not be $1 Trillion Dollars, but rather $1.5 Trillion Dollars," Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday evening. </p><p>"This will allow us to build the "Dream Military" that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe." </p><p>The president said he came up with the number after tariff revenues created a surplus of cash. He claimed the levies were bringing in enough money to pay for both a major boost to the defense budget "easily," pay down the national debt, which is more than $38 trillion, and offer "a substantial dividend to moderate income patriots."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-sends-901b-defense-bill-trump-after-clashes-over-boat-strike-dc-airspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SENATE SENDS $901B DEFENSE BILL TO TRUMP AFTER CLASHES OVER BOAT STRIKE, DC AIRSPACE</strong></a></p><p>The boost likely reflects efforts to fund Trump’s ambitious military plans, from the Golden Dome homeland missile defense shield to a new "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-unveils-golden-fleet-navy-battleships-touts-them-more-powerful-than-any-ship-ever-built" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump class" of battleships</a>.</p><p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the increased budget would cost about $5 trillion from 2027 to 2035, or $5.7 trillion with interest. Tariff revenues, the group found, would cover about half the cost — $2.5 trillion, or $3 trillion with interest. </p><p>The Supreme Court is expected to rule in a major case Friday that will determine the legality of Trump’s sweeping tariff strategy.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-unveils-900b-defense-bill-targeting-china-tech-bans-investment-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CONGRESS UNVEILS $900B DEFENSE BILL TARGETING CHINA WITH TECH BANS, INVESTMENT CRACKDOWN, US TROOP PAY RAISE</strong></a></p><p>In 2026, the defense budget is expected to breach $1 trillion for the first time thanks to a $150 billion reconciliation bill Congress passed to boost the expected $900 billion defense spending legislation for fiscal year 2026. Congress has yet to pass a full-year defense budget for 2026.</p><p>Some Republicans have long called for a major increase to defense spending to bring the topline total to 5% of GDP, as the $1.5 trillion budget would do, up from the current 3.5%.</p><p>Trump has ramped up pressure on Europe to increase its <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/national-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national security spending</a> to 5% of GDP — 3.5% on core military requirements and 1.5% on defense-related areas like cybersecurity and critical infrastructure.</p><p>Trump’s budget announcement came hours after defense stocks took a dip when he condemned the performance rates of major defense contractors. In a separate Truth Social post, he announced he would not allow defense firms to buy back their own stocks, offer large salaries to executives or issue dividends to shareholders. </p><p>"Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military, and our Allies," he said. </p><p>"​<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Defense Companies</a> are not producing our Great Military Equipment rapidly enough and, once produced, not maintaining it properly or quickly."</p><p>He said that executives would not be allowed to make above $5 million until they build new production plants.</p><p>Stock buybacks, dividends and executive compensation generally are governed by securities law, state corporate law and private contracts, and cannot be broadly restricted without congressional action.</p><p>An executive order the White House released Wednesday frames the restrictions as conditions on future defense contracts, rather than a blanket prohibition. The order directs the secretary of war to ensure that new contracts include provisions barring stock buybacks and corporate distributions during periods of underperformance, non-compliance or inadequate production, as determined by the Pentagon.</p>
