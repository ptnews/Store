<p>Randi Weingarten, the leader of the American Federation of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/teachers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teachers</a>, has announced that she is leaving X due to "hate" and "disinformation."</p><p>"It’s time to let X/<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> go. This platform’s decline from a vibrant public square to what is now a platform for hate, disinformation &amp; manipulation has been painful to experience. Find me &amp; the AFT on Bluesky, Substack, Threads, Instagram, or Facebook," Weingarten announced <a href="https://x.com/rweingarten/status/2011198998946685037" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">on Tuesday</a>.</p><p>Weingarten is active on Bluesky, a liberal-leaning social media platform. Many once-prominent users of Twitter, now known as X since <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> bought it, solely post on Bluesky.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oklahoma-state-superintendent-ryan-walters-leaving-new-job-where-he-wage-war-against-teachers-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OKLAHOMA STATE SUPERINTENDENT RYAN WALTERS LEAVING FOR NEW JOB WHERE HE WILL WAGE WAR AGAINST TEACHERS UNIONS</strong></a></p><p>Weingarten told Reuters that both her account, and the American Federation of Teachers' account, would cease posting on X.</p><p>Weingarten explained further that the social media site’s creation of "sickening" images of children drove her to leave.</p><p>According to Reuters, Weingarten "said that the site had already been degraded by extremists and trolls since Elon Musk's 2022 takeover, before which the platform was known as Twitter." </p><p>"But the recent proliferation of nonconsensual images of women and children in bikinis or underwear generated by X's artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok, had made the site unusable, she said," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/musks-ai-bot-grok-limits-image-generation-x-paid-users-after-backlash-2026-01-09/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">per Reuters</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/chicago-teachers-union-honors-black-militant-convicted-cop-killer-after-death-cuba-drawing-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION HONORS BLACK MILITANT CONVICTED COP-KILLER AFTER DEATH IN CUBA, DRAWING BACKLASH</strong></a></p><p>"The Grok AI image generator, with no safeguards, was the last straw," Weingarten told Reuters. "From tomorrow on, we're not using Twitter, or X."</p><p>"It’s not an easy decision but it’s the right decision," Weingarten said. "You have to draw a line. If you’re on Team Humanity and you believe we have to protect children, in particular, you have to draw this line."</p><p>Neither The American Federation of Teachers, X, nor Grok immediately responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.</p><p>The leader of the 1.8 million-member union had previously been vocal about criticizing the Trump administration and endorsed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kamala Harris</a> in the 2024 election. The American Federation of Teachers recently released a statement calling for ICE to stay away from schools.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/randi-weingarten-gives-teachers-good-advice-once" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OPINION: RANDI WEINGARTEN GIVES TEACHERS GOOD ADVICE FOR ONCE</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p><p>"Why can’t this administration focus on working with communities to help them thrive, instead of stoking fear, violence and death?
