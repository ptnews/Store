<p>The son of convicted 8 Passengers YouTube blogger Ruby Franke is speaking out nearly two years after his mother was sentenced to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to six decades in prison</a> for aggravated child abuse. </p><p>Chad Franke, 20, is sharing his side of the story in a series of TikTok videos by reading diary entries from 2023, one year before his mother sentenced in a Utah courtroom, <a href="https://people.com/chad-franke-reads-diary-entry-1-year-before-mom-rubys-prison-sentence-11891317" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>according to</u></a> People. </p><p>"Hi, my name is Chad, and I used to be very brainwashed," he said in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chadwfranke/video/7598127467076898078" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>the first video.</u></a> "And, no, I’m not kidding. You can look me up." </p><p>Throughout the video, Chad explained he has received countless requests from his TikTok followers to "write a book on my story" but conceded he feels he is not a "very good writer" and does not want a third party telling his side of things.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mommy-blogger-ruby-franke-husband-says-some-crazy-s-t-went-abuse-accomplices-5-3m-fortress" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MOMMY BLOGGER RUBY FRANKE'S HUSBAND SAYS ‘SOME CRAZY S---’ WENT ON IN ABUSE ACCOMPLICE'S $5.3M FORTRESS</u></strong></a></p><p>"Then I remembered I kind of wrote <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/family" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>my own story</u></a> myself," Chad said, pointing to a journal in which he wrote every day during that period of his life. </p><p>"And to show you guys how real it was for every single day of the year, I will go back to 2023, two years ago, and read every single journal entry that I wrote." </p><p>In the second video installment, Chad read an entry dated Jan. 22, 2023, detailing how he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>visited church</u></a> with his roommates before playing Mario Kart and later cooked "funeral potatoes."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/youtube-mommy-blogger-ruby-franke-co-host-jodi-hildebrandt-sentenced-child-abuse-dark-delusion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>YOUTUBE MOMMY BLOGGER RUBY FRANKE, CO-HOST JODI HILDEBRANDT SENTENCED FOR CHILD ABUSE: ‘DARK DELUSION’</u></strong></a></p><p>"And then I called mom," Chad said. </p><p>"We talked for two hours about removing lust. It's a little more complicated and difficult than I thought," he said, adding he was working as a lifeguard at the time. </p><p>"Being at the pool has many opportunities to show God I will not lust anymore," he continued, before listing a series of goals he wanted to accomplish within the upcoming week. "Scripture study, scripture notes, traveling to work, finishing and starting a finance book, finish a 12-hour Python coding course, and keep on cooking."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/utah-police-discover-panic-room-inside-abusive-mommy-blogger-accomplices-5-3m-desert-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>UTAH POLICE DISCOVER ‘PANIC ROOM’ INSIDE ABUSIVE MOMMY BLOGGER ACCOMPLICE'S $5.3M DESERT HOME</u></strong></a></p><p>Chad then addressed his viewers to clarify his views regarding religion and his situation at the time the entry was written. </p><p>"I want to make it very clear that not all of this is bad," he said. "Scripture study, not bad. Cooking, obviously not bad. And talking to my brainwashed mom at the time, also not bad.</p><p>"This is just me giving my story. This isn't me saying everything is bad."</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxTrueCrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X</u></strong></a></p><p>In a third video posted to TikTok, Chad shared another journal entry from the following day in 2023, in which he mulled over the concept of "lust" and his job as a lifeguard at a local pool. </p><p>"Being a lifeguard, I just watch people's choices over and over," he wrote. "I have two opportunities to either feel compassion or lust. It is difficult to rid lust after a lifetime of feeding it.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SIGN UP TO GET TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"But, at the pool, I have more and more chances to evidence. I will not lust. It will take more practice. And I have not spoken the lustful language or shared lustful comments. It is all immature, and I need and want to grow into a hard-working and principled man. I need to be disciplined."</p><p>Franke earned an impressive online following in 2015 by posting videos of her children — Chad, Julie, Abby, Russell, Shari and Eve — on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/influencers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>her family’s YouTube channel</u></a>, 8 Passengers. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/utah" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah blogger</a> quickly rose to fame, earning over 2 million followers on her platform.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SEND US A TIP HERE</u></strong></a></p><p>However, the popularity of the family’s YouTube channel began to fall after Chad mentioned in a video that he had been forced to sleep on a beanbag chair for several months as punishment. </p><p>Seven years later, Franke began partnering with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>controversial family therapist</u></a> Jodi Hildebrandt on a podcast and joint Instagram account, "Moms of Truth," where the pair shared intense and often abusive parenting tactics.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/true-crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING?

Both Franke and Hildebrandt were sentenced to four consecutive terms between a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 60 years in prison in February 2024.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Audrey Conklin contributed to this report.  </i></p>
