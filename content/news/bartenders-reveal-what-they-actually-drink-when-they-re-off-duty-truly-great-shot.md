<p>Bartenders spend their shifts <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crafting drinks</a> to suit their customers' many tastes — but their own preferences often look quite different once the bar closes.</p><p>After hours of mixing cocktails, some bartenders reach for something familiar and comforting, rather than what patrons might expect. </p><p>Sometimes it's a popular staple; other times, it's a lesser-known pour reserved for industry insiders.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/how-much-should-you-tip-bartenders-experts-reveal-real-number"><strong><u>HOW MUCH SHOULD YOU TIP BARTENDERS? EXPERTS REVEAL THE REAL NUMBER</u></strong></a></p><p>Fox News Digital spoke with three <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/bars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bartenders across the country</a> to find out what they order for themselves when they step out from behind the bar.</p><p>Here are six of their top choices.</p><p>A coffee liqueur-bourbon hybrid is a favorite of Stephanie Cohen, head bartender of The Port of Call in Mystic, Connecticut. </p><p>"One of my go-to shots is a 50/50 split base shot composed of Veritable Coffee Liqueur and Ship's Bell Bourbon," she said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/gen-z-drinkers-leave-bartenders-frustrated-shrinking-tips-terrible-trend-emerges"><strong><u>GEN Z DRINKERS LEAVE BARTENDERS FRUSTRATED WITH SHRINKING TIPS AS 'TERRIBLE' TREND EMERGES</u></strong></a></p><p>"I think after a big meal, I tend to want something a bit stronger and richer, but not necessarily higher ABV," referring to alcohol by volume.</p><p>The honey and chocolate flavors of Veritable Coffee Liqueur, she added, are "lifted by the rounded-out warm spices in Ship's Bell Bourbon."</p><p> "I couldn't think of a bad time to enjoy a mini stirred <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffee martini,</a>" Cohen added.</p><p>Aleks Petrashek, a bartender and manager at Barrel Proof in New Orleans, said he recommends a "whiskey cocktail in a glass" experience with a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/drinks/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miller High Life</a> pony chaser.</p><p>"For a truly great shot, you want something that offers more than just a quick burn," he said.</p><p>"I suggest a chilled shot of Big Easy Whiskey with a High Life pony chaser. Served straight out of a freezer, the low temperature mellows the proof and the chilling highlights the inherent complexity of the whiskey."</p><p>Petrashek spoke highly of the layered flavors — which include "a smooth initial sweetness, followed by notes of caramel and spice, finishing with a satisfying warmth."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/tequila-good-you-expert-reveals-what-makes-reasonable-choice-drinkers"><strong><u>IS TEQUILA GOOD FOR YOU? EXPERT REVEALS WHAT MAKES IT A 'REASONABLE CHOICE' FOR DRINKERS</u></strong></a></p><p>"It's a premium, complex flavor profile in a single gulp, making it a fantastic value and a sophisticated, fast choice for the whiskey lover."</p><p>For those looking for a simple, holiday-like shot, Bartender Magazine's Ryan Foley suggested Rumple Minze peppermint schnapps.</p><p>The New Jersey-based expert said that the 100-proof peppermint schnapps has been "a bartender favorite for a while."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Peppermint schnapps "give you a minty, cooling feeling while you enjoy [them]," he said.</p><p>Bottles range from $30 to $35, Foley added, making them an affordable shot.</p><p>Made from 100% Blue Weber agave, Foley called these coconut-flavored-infused shots "a crowd pleaser."</p><p>"The natural coconut flavors also lead it to be mixed beautifully in cocktails, like an espresso martini or margarita, and even unique shots with orange juice," he suggested. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>Foley called the tequila "great value for any occasion and something growing in popularity with the bartender community."</p><p>Green tea shots are popular with bargoers and bartenders alike, Foley said.</p><p>"You will see [and] hear people ordering these a lot at bars or during a fun, energetic night out," he said.</p><p>There's no actual tea in these shots. Rather, they're made with equal parts Jameson Irish whiskey, peach schnapps and sour mix, with a splash of lemon-lime soda, Foley said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"These are things that a majority of bars have, making this available and easy to order," Foley added.</p><p>M&amp;M shots are made of mezcal and Amaro Montenegro — and they don't exactly taste like candy.</p><p>Mezcal lends smokiness, earthiness and a little bitterness to the shot — while Amaro Montenegro is sweet and herbal, Foley said.</p><p>These shots are a bartender's favorite because the products on their own "are amazing." When combined, they "make a mix that tastes <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/dessert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like dessert,</a>" Foley said.</p><p>Not every bar has mezcal, so M&amp;M shots are more of an "if you know, you know" selection, Foley said — making them "more common with bartenders and those into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/meals/cocktail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cocktail culture.</a>"</p>
