<p>Tuya Smart just introduced Aura, its first <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI-powered companion</a> robot made for pets.</p><p>Aura is designed specifically for household cats and dogs, with AI trained to recognize their behaviors, movements and vocal cues. The idea behind Aura is simple. Pets need more than food bowls and cameras. They need attention, interaction and reassurance. </p><p>Aura stays active in the home, watches for behavior changes and responds in real time so owners can better understand how their pets are doing. Many pets struggle when left alone for long hours. Small changes often show up first. A dog may stop playing. A cat may hide or groom excessively. These signs can point to stress or anxiety. Aura steps in during those quiet stretches, offering engagement instead of an empty room.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

Emotional care is a different story. Pets are social. When routines change, their mood can shift quickly. Aura tracks behavior and listens for changes in sound patterns. It can tell whether a pet feels excited, anxious, lonely, or relaxed. Aura then sends real-time emotional updates to an owner's phone. That makes it easier to spot issues early rather than guessing after the fact.</p><p>Aura acts more like a companion than a device that sits still. Several systems work together throughout the day to keep <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/pets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pets engaged.</a> Key features include:</p><p>Instead of waiting for a button press, Aura looks for opportunities to engage. It turns long, quiet hours into moments of play and stimulation.</p><p>Aura also keeps an eye out for moments worth saving. Using AI pet recognition and intelligent tracking, it captures everyday highlights like playful bursts, calm naps and funny interactions. Aura can automatically turn these clips into short videos. That helps owners stay connected and feel closer to their pets even when they are away. It also makes it easier to capture moments you might never catch on your own and share them with family or post on social media.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/ai-photo-match-reunites-texas-woman-lost-cat-after-103-days" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>AI PHOTO MATCH REUNITES TEXAS WOMAN WITH LOST CAT AFTER 103 DAYS</u></strong></a></p><p>Movement is a big part of Aura's role in the home. With V-SLAM navigation, binocular vision and AIVI object recognition, Aura moves freely while avoiding obstacles. When the battery runs low, it returns to its feeding and charging dock on its own. That keeps it ready without constant attention from owners.</p><p>Aura connects to Tuya's broader ecosystem, which opens access to services beyond the home. These include <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/pet-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart pet boarding,</a> health and medical care, behavior training, grooming, customization and community tools. Instead of handling one task, Aura becomes a central hub for pet care that can evolve over time.</p><p>Aura focuses on pets today, but the technology behind it reaches further. Emotional awareness, proactive assistance and ecosystem integration could also support elder care, home monitoring and family connectivity. Starting with pets gives Tuya a clear emotional use case while setting the stage for future home robotics.<br> </p><p><strong>Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?</strong></p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?

The company <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/robots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled the robot</a> earlier this month at CES 2026, but details on availability and cost remain unclear. Those specifics are likely to come closer to a wider consumer launch. Even so, Aura signals a shift in how smart home technology shows up for pets. It moves beyond simple monitoring and leans into interaction and emotional awareness. If Aura delivers on its promise, it could help pet owners feel more comfortable leaving their pets home alone while staying connected throughout the day.</p><p>If technology can read your pet's emotions and respond in real time, would you trust it to become part of your home routine, or would that feel like too much?
