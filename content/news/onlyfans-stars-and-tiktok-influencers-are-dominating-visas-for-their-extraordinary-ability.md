<p>It was once popular for international music stars and actors to stay in the U.S. for their jobs and careers. </p><p>Today, the notion is attracting a new type of "talent."</p><p>OnlyFans stars, TikTok influencers and popular content creators are applying for O-1 visas to work in this country.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</strong></a></p><p>The visas are intended for an individual who possesses "extraordinary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ability in the sciences</a>, arts, education, business or athletics, or who has a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and has been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements," according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p><p>A U.S. employer, U.S. agent or foreign employer through a U.S. agent needs to file on the person's behalf, along with required evidence, the USCIS also says. </p><p>Pennsylvania-based immigration attorney Raymond Lahoud told Fox News Digital, "O-1B visas have been dominated by influencers and content creators."</p><p>He added, "We see applicants who appear on various platforms with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/viral-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millions of followers</a> and earning millions of dollars."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>"If a potential non-immigrant who is the world's most famous OnlyFans star meets the O-1B requirements, who am I to judge?  We're getting that visa," he added.</p><p>He said the rise in the number of creators seeking visas is somewhat of a recent phenomenon.</p><p>"During <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pandemic</a>, the films were recording, the influencers were posting and the entire globe was at home reading or watching," said Lahoud.</p><p>A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O-1 visa issuances</a> for FY 2024 and FY 2025 remained steady at approximately 20,000."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/5-big-immigration-changes-taking-effect-across-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>5 BIG IMMIGRATION CHANGES TAKING EFFECT ACROSS THE US</strong></a></p><p>Applicants are judged by the USCIS to determine if they're eligible for an O-1 visa.</p><p>Individuals "must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability," the USCIS also notes on its website. </p><p>Lahoud said the adjudicators follow a flowchart — and if the applicant meets the minimum criteria, the person can expect an approval notice to arrive within days.</p><p>"There is some ease given the ability to quickly gather data and metrics through various web platforms and mind-blowing applications," he said.</p><p>While the metrics are high, Lahoud said OnlyFans models may have millions of followers — "while the scientist who posts hundreds of studies on Google Scholar is lucky to score 20 or so readers and a few citations."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>He said an influencer is no different from a writer or any other job position — and when it comes to OnlyFans stars, "acting is acting."</p><p>"The thing is that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the OnlyFans film</a> will make its way across the globe faster than any DVD or Netflix special," he added.</p>
