<p>Archaeologists digging in the East End of London recently <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered compelling</a> signs of luxury in a neighborhood long labeled poor — including a seal from a bottle of French wine. </p><p>The wine seal was of particular interest, as it came from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/jaw-dropping-medieval-castle-100-rooms-hits-market-nearly-1000-years-historyhttps://www.foxnews.com/travel/jaw-dropping-medieval-castle-100-rooms-hits-market-nearly-1000-years-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chateau Margaux,</a> a prestigious French vineyard once favored by former President Thomas Jefferson as well as British Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole. A release on Jan. 12 from the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) shared the details. </p><p>"Remarkably, the MOLA team uncovered a seal from one of these prized wine bottles during their excavations," the organization said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/archaeologists-unearth-secrets-lancaster-countys-oldest-tavern-buried-centuries-pasture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH SECRETS OF LANCASTER COUNTY'S OLDEST TAVERN, BURIED FOR CENTURIES BENEATH PASTURE</strong></a></p><p>The excavations took place ahead of SEGRO Park Wapping, an industrial development in the Wapping area of East London, in the borough of Tower Hamlets.</p><p>The seal from the bottle of French wine was found along with the floor of a chapel, terrace house foundations, and "wells, soakaways and rubbish pits full of pottery and clay pipes in the gardens."</p><p>Archaeologists also found numerous artifacts left behind by Victorian children, including a slate school tablet "covered with children’s scribbles and handwriting."</p><p>In addition, archaeologists found "alleys" — ceramic marbles designed to resemble alabaster stone — that children once played with.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"They were found inside a covered, brick-lined drain, perhaps lost during a particularly enthusiastic match," the release added.</p><p>Excavators knew the site was home to a school dating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back to the 1530s,</a> as well as alms houses that lasted on the site from the 1550s to the late 19th century, according to MOLA's release.</p><p>The houses "provided homes and a monthly stipend for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">older local people</a> in need," the release noted.</p><p>"Together these help build a picture of the everyday lives of the people who once called this area home," the release added.</p><p>Alex Banks, MOLA senior archaeologist, told Fox News Digital that experts are still investigating exactly how old the artifacts are.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"We're currently exploring this as part of our post-excavation work on the site, so we hope to be able to share more soon," he said.</p><p>Archaeologists are also investigating what exactly the scribbles say. </p><p>Blanks added that artifacts related to children "are far less frequent [to come across] compared to those relating to adults."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>He cited <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/wine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the French wine seal</a> as one of the most surprising discoveries of the excavation. </p><p>Excavators also found <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/discover-luxury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expensive imported pottery</a> and wine glasses — which pushes back on the long-held idea that Wapping was always a uniformly poor area.</p><p>"Finds like this [reveal that] this <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">area of London</a> close to the Ratcliff Highway had a more complex social history in the 1700s and 1800s than often biased contemporary sources would have you believe," said Blanks.</p><p>"In reality, it was a very diverse area — just like the East End of London is today."</p>
