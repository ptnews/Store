<p>Federal authorities have arrested two anti-ICE agitators after a mob stormed a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday.</p><p>Bondi named <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/far-left-agitator-who-organized-minnesota-church-storming-raked-over-1-million-from-nonprofit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nekima Levy Armstrong</a> and Chauntyll Louisa Allen as the suspects. FBI Director Kash Patel says the pair are charged with violating the FACE Act, which prohibits interfering with the exercise of religion at a place of worship.</p><p>"Minutes ago at my direction, HSI and FBI agents executed an arrest in Minnesota. So far, we have arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, who allegedly played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota," Bondi wrote on X.</p><p>"A second arrest has been made at my direction. Chauntyll Louisa Allen has been taken into custody," she announced minutes later.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyt-slammed-over-report-saying-protest-minnesota-church-service-adds-tensions-over-ice-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NYT SLAMMED OVER REPORT SAYING PROTEST AT MINNESOTA CHURCH SERVICE 'ADDS TO TENSIONS OVER ICE TACTICS'</u></strong></a></p><p>"We will share more updates as they become available. Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP," she added.</p><p>Armstrong, whose website identifies her as a civil rights lawyer and "scholar-activist," helped to organize the storming of Cities Church in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>in St. Paul</u></a> on Sunday.</p><p>Allen is a member of the St. Paul School Board who also helped organize the protest.</p><p>Armstrong continued to harass people connected with the church as recently as Wednesday, when she accused one of its pastors of having a "conflict of interest" due to working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/st-paul-pastor-denounces-anti-ice-agitators-who-disrupted-church-service-says-were-here-worship-jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>ST PAUL PASTOR DENOUNCES ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO DISRUPTED CHURCH SERVICE, SAYS 'WE'RE HERE TO WORSHIP JESUS'</u></strong></a></p><p>Armstrong claimed in a Facebook post that one of the church’s pastors is a leader at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The demonstration is one of many throughout the Twin Cities in protest of the federal government’s surge of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/immigrant-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>immigration enforcement</u></a> officials to crack down on widespread fraud taking place in the state.</p><p>The Sunday attack saw dozens of agitators storm Cities Church during its service.

She has also been a key organizer of the boycotts against Target over its decision to scale back its diversity, equity and inclusion programs.</p><p>In a September 26 post, Armstrong had high <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/flashback-far-left-activist-who-organized-minnesota-church-storming-praised-cop-killer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>praise for Joanne Chesimard</u></a>, also known as Assata Shakur, who was convicted of the murder of State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1977. Armstrong called her "a brave, wise, powerful, and revolutionary Black woman."</p><p><i>Fox News' Peter Pinedo contributed to this report.</i></p>
