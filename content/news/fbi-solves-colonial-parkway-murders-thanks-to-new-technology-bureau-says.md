"Right now, the way the laws are set up, even though Alan Wade Wilmer Sr. is a serial killer and has killed at least six people, including my sister, and her girlfriend Rebecca Dowski, we do not have the capability to upload his DNA into CODIS, because he was never convicted of a crime before he died in 2017."</p><p>The families are working to amend current laws to bring other unsolved cases to a close.</p><p>FBI Norfolk said investigators will continue to actively pursue unsolved cases related to the Colonial Parkway murders.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Chris Eberhart contributed to this report.</i></p>
