Valrose called 911 and requested police conduct a wellness check at the Tepe residence after Spencer didn't show up to work. </p><p>"Spencer works with me and he did not show up to work this morning and we <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>cannot get ahold of him</u></a> or his family," Valrose said. "He is always on time and he would contact us if there is any issues whatsoever… we're very, very concerned because this is very out of character and we can't get in touch with his wife, which is probably the more concerning thing."</p><p>Following the 911 call, call logs obtained by Fox News Digital revealed that a Columbus Police Department officer went to the Tepes' house and knocked on the front and back door "multiple times" with no answer.</p><p>One of Spencer's friends went to his house and called 911 at 9:57 a.m., telling the dispatcher that he "thought he heard one of [the kids] yelling," according to the call log.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/newlywed-couple-found-dead-car-murder-suicide-days-before-first-anniversary-police-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>NEWLYWED COUPLE FOUND DEAD IN CAR FROM MURDER-SUICIDE DAYS BEFORE FIRST ANNIVERSARY, POLICE SAY</u></strong></a></p><p>A separate 911 caller told the dispatcher that a body could be seen inside the Tepes' house.</p><p>"We just came here and he appears dead. He's laying next to his bed, off of his bed in his blood. I can't get closer to see more than that," the caller said. "I can tell he's obviously not breathing or anything."</p><p>A baby was also heard crying inside the house, according to the dispatch records.</p><p>At 10:13 a.m., dispatch records reveal that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullet casings were found</a> at the crime scene.</p><p>In a statement released Friday, the couple's family said they are "heartbroken beyond words," and called the deaths "tragic and senseless."</p><p>"They were extraordinary people whose lives were filled with love, joy, and deep connection to others," read the statement. "Spencer, a graduate of The Ohio State University, was known as a devoted and proud father, a loving partner, and a friend to everyone he met," the family statement said, adding that he was "intelligent, warm, and endlessly welcoming."</p><p>Spencer was involved with the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization, his family said.</p><p>Monique was described by family members as a "loving, patient and joyful mother whose warmth defined her."</p><p>Rob Misleh, Spencer's brother-in-law, told WSYX that the couple, married in 2021, was going to celebrate their five-year anniversary next month.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Julia Bonavita and Elizabeth Pritchett contributed to this report.</i></p>
