<p>A judge ruled that the transcript and audio recording of a closed-door hearing involving the accused assassin of Charlie Kirk can be released in redacted forms during a hearing on how much access the public should have as his capital case proceeds in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/utah" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Provo, Utah</a>.</p><p>Fourth District Judge Tony Graf Jr. said the redactions amounted to 246 words in the 80-page transcript. The transcript is expected to be released by the end of the day, but Graf said it would take about two weeks to redact and release the audio recording.</p><p>Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of firing a single shot from a rooftop overlooking a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, striking the 31-year-old conservative speaker in the neck as he fielded questions from people in the audience in a courtyard at the heart of campus.</p><p>Robinson was not seen in court and spoke only in response to a question from the judge at the start of the hearing.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/charlie-kirk-alleged-assassin-tyler-robinson-tries-boot-prosecutors-from-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CHARLIE KIRK'S ALLEGED ASSASSIN TYLER ROBINSON TRIES TO BOOT PROSECUTORS FROM CASE</strong></a></p><p>Graf addressed two issues — whether transcripts from the sealed hearing earlier this year should be made public and the extent of access the media and public should have to the case going forward.</p><p>A group of local and national media outlets, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a>, have filed a motion for limited intervention. Lawyers for the group asked Graf for formal recognition from the court, advance notice of attempts to seal future hearings or otherwise limit access to the courtroom, including by banning cameras, and to give the media time to oppose such restrictions.</p><p>He denied the motion, however, cited a prior order telling lawyers for both sides they must notify the media before attempting to have future hearings behind closed doors. The parties are not required to notify the media before potential future attempts to limit cameras or other electronic coverage of the courtroom.</p><p>Robinson has made only one in-person court appearance since the September slaying, and some of the case has unfolded behind closed doors, prompting the media group to demand greater transparency and the chance to oppose future secretive proceedings.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/charlie-kirks-widow-fights-keep-news-cameras-courtroom-accused-assassins-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CHARLIE KIRK'S WIDOW FIGHTS TO KEEP NEWS CAMERAS IN COURTROOM FOR ACCUSED ASSASSIN'S TRIAL</u></strong></a></p><p>Robinson's defense had asked Graf to kick cameras out of the courtroom, but the judge ruled that an outright ban on cameras would be a "disproportionate" response to the defendant's concerns and issued limitations on what can and can't be shown.</p><p>Earlier this month, he promised to "be narrow" when weighing what parts of the sealed hearing should remain that way.</p><p>"[I would] rather do it right and take more time than to be rash and miss the mark," he said.</p><p>Kirk, who founded Turning Point USA to bring conservative voices to college campuses, died from a catastrophic gunshot wound as Robinson allegedly fled into a nearby neighborhood, ditching the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspected murder weapon</a>, a Mauser .30-06 rifle, along the way.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/trial-charlie-kirk-alleged-assassin-will-test-new-judge-career-defining-moment-attorneys-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRIAL FOR CHARLIE KIRK’S ALLEGED ASSASSIN WILL TEST NEW JUDGE IN ‘CAREER-DEFINING MOMENT,’ ATTORNEYS SAY</u></strong></a></p><p>The victim was a married father of two.</p><p>The suspected killer returned home to southern Utah, about a four-hour drive, and allegedly confessed to his roommate and romantic partner, Lance Twiggs, and to his parents before turning himself in to Washington County deputies.</p><p>Twiggs is cooperating with investigators and has not been charged with a crime. Authorities also credited the parents with helping convince Robinson to surrender.</p><p>The accused assassin is due back in court on Jan. 16 in person for a longer hearing. Among the issues to be heard then is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/charlie-kirk-alleged-assassin-tyler-robinson-tries-boot-prosecutors-from-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a motion from the defense</a> demanding that one of the prosecutors who had a relative present when Kirk was killed to be recused from the case.</p><p>Robinson faces seven charges, including aggravated murder, which carries the potential death penalty, felony discharge of a firearm, obstruction and witness tampering.</p><p>He has not yet entered a plea.</p><p><i>Fox News' Melissa Chrise, Stepheny Price and Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report.</i></p>
