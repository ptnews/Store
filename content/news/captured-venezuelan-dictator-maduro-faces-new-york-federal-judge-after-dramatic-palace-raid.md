<p>Nicolas Maduro, the dethroned Venezuelan dictator indicted on major drug trafficking and weapons charges in the United States, is expected in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal court in New York</a> Monday for his arraignment, days after American forces captured him in his own presidential palace.</p><p>The hearing, in which Maduro will be formally told the charges against him, is set for noon. His wife, Cilia Flores, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/venezuelan-leader-maduro-lands-new-york-after-being-captured-us-forces-drug-conspiracy-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was arrested in</a> the raid and is also due in court. Like her husband, she was a high-level official in Venezuela's socialist regime.</p><p>Maduro faces four charges: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.</p><p>"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/corruption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positions of public trust and corrupted</a> once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States," federal prosecutors wrote in a superseding indictment unveiled over the weekend.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-maduro-ties-suffer-major-blow-following-us-operation-capture-venezuelan-dictator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN AND MADURO TIES SUFFER MAJOR BLOW FOLLOWING US OPERATION AND CAPTURE OF VENEZUELAN DICTATOR</strong></a></p><p>Flores faces three: cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.</p><p>Similar proceedings are usually short. There won’t be any witness testimony, the defendants will have a chance to enter their pleas, and the judge will set the next court date and address the subject of pretrial release.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bail is highly unlikely</a>, according to legal experts.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/venezuelan-leader-maduro-lands-new-york-after-being-captured-us-forces-drug-conspiracy-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VENEZUELAN LEADER MADURO LANDS IN NEW YORK AFTER BEING CAPTURED BY US FORCES ON DRUG CONSPIRACY CHARGES</strong></a></p><p>"I think I have a better chance of winning the next Power Ball," David Gelman, a Philadelphia-area defense attorney, told Fox News Digital.
