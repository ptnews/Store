<p>When Beverly D’Angelo became a mom at age 49, she was determined to raise her children away from the glaring Hollywood spotlight.</p><p>The "National Lampoon" star, 74, welcomed twins Anton and Olivia Pacino in 2001 with then-partner Al Pacino. The couple were together from 1997 to 2003.</p><p>The actress is kicking off the new year by starring alongside Hayden Panettiere in the psychological thriller "Sleepwalker."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/national-lampoon-star-beverly-dangelo-says-shed-tell-younger-self-do-more-nudity-hollywood-career" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>‘NATIONAL LAMPOON’ STAR BEVERLY D'ANGELO SAYS SHE'D TELL YOUNGER SELF TO 'DO MORE NUDITY' IN HOLLYWOOD CAREER</strong></a></p><p>"There’s this thing that happens when you have kids," D’Angelo told Fox News Digital. "All of a sudden, you go, ‘Oh, wait a minute, my parents.’ You look at how you were raised. Maybe some of the things that you thought were a drag when you were a kid turn out to be exactly what you want to pass on. And my value system has never included a lot of hype or a lot of focus on fame."</p><p>"I’m <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the Midwest</a>," she said. "In retrospect, even though I was a real rebel, leaving home at 17, I had a great upbringing. Everything was clear. There were good people who didn’t lie."</p><p>"You follow the golden rules — find something you can do well, be responsible with it and embrace your community," D'Angelo continued. "You know, all the four-square values. American values. And I really had a pretty all-American upbringing for as wild as my life has been."</p><p>D’Angelo stressed she wanted to give her children as normal an upbringing as possible.</p><p><strong>WATCH: CHEVY CHASE ON HAND TO SUPPORT SYLVESTER STALLONE</strong></p><p>"I raised them with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener">values of honesty, responsibility</a> and finding your gifts," she said. "I wanted them to focus on that."</p><p>D’Angelo noted she didn't think twice about prioritizing her children over her Hollywood career.</p><p>"I had kids really late — <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/babies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I gave birth to twins</a> six weeks after I turned 49," she explained. "It was really important to me to place them at the center of my world. So, I wouldn’t do any films that would take me out of town for any amount of time. I did television, I did some indie films and things like that, but my focus was really to always be emotionally and physically available to my kids."</p><p>"And I’ve got to make a confession: I’m not a careerist," she admitted. "I have never been. Everything I’ve done is because I love a script or a character. But as far as pursuing a career, I wasn’t somebody who had a dream like, ‘One day I’m going to grow up and become an actress.’ That’s not me. I never thought, ‘If I do this role, maybe I’ll get this other role.’ I’ve always just been motivated by a profound need to express myself."</p><p>After high school, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/ohio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohio native</a> moved to California and landed a job at Hanna-Barbera Studios. She later moved to Canada, where she trained as a studio vocalist before landing a Broadway role in "Rockabye Hamlet."</p><p>"Instead of being pursued by the music industry, it was casting directors for films," said D’Angelo. "I got my Screen Actors Guild card with a line in ‘Annie Hall.’ And I just worked, worked, worked. It took 14 auditions for the film ‘Hair’ that landed me the lead role of Sheila. I worked on that film with a fantastic director, Miloš Forman." </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"He was a very important director in the whole scheme of things," she continued. "He really held my hand and introduced me to the world of film. That’s really where I got my <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acting experience</a>. It’s always been in film."</p><p>"My acting was learned. It all came from being in the moment. That’s what you have to do — just be in the moment."</p><p>When asked whether she ever felt pressure to be a sex symbol in Hollywood, D’Angelo didn’t hesitate: "One hundred percent."</p><p>"And then I left," she said. "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I moved to Italy</a>. I don’t know what else to say except I really wasn’t a careerist. I didn’t plot, I didn’t plan. I’ve always had great people around me. I had a fantastic agent for a long time. I have a wonderful agent now, but again, I was never a plotter or a planner."</p><p>D’Angelo was married to Italian duke Lorenzo Salviati from 1981 to 1995.</p><p>Today, D’Angelo stays busy, acting on her own terms — and often playing a role she knows well.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

"You have something to say in your 20s, your 30s and your 40s. And then, you don’t find a lot of people writing what women have to say as time goes on."</p><p>"The fantastic thing about aging is that you have this wealth of experience," D'Angelo continued. "You can relate to so much more. I’m not saying it entitles you to become a know-it-all. You just have a greater understanding of the world."</p><p>"I’ve been really lucky to have been met with so many opportunities," she reflected. "It’s a whole new phase — fantastic, really. And you know what? Every single role I’ve done in the past year has been a mother. That’s a recurring theme. I do like to think that with the ‘Vacation’ movies, I was the original MILF."</p>
