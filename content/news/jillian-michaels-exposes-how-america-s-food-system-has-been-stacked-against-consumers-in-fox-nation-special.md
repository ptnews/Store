They lobby your politicians to make them work on their behalf. The sicker we are, the more money they make," she told co-host Ainsley Earhardt.</p><p>"We need the government working on our behalf to remove all of this junk, to lower drug prices when we do need these medications, to help us not get as sick by giving us healthier food in a way that's more affordable and more accessible."</p><p>Michaels' "Fox &amp; Friends" appearance came on the heels of the Trump administration's historic reset of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. nutrition policy</a>, an inverted pyramid which prioritized real foods chock-full of protein and healthy fats over grains and simple carbohydrates to battle systemic diseases.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/mobile-kitchens-roll-out-west-virginia-fight-states-high-obesity-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MOBILE TEACHING KITCHENS ROLL OUT IN WEST VIRGINIA TO FIGHT STATE'S HIGH OBESITY RATE</strong></a></p><p>FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said Thursday that the overhaul challenges the longstanding "dogma" that providing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-fat dairy options</a> is beneficial for children, telling Fox News that guidelines for protein increased by 50 to 100 percent, making it the priority macronutrient.</p><p>Michaels explained that government guidelines inform public school and military nutrition in addition to education about what is best to eat.</p><p>The administration's focus on whole foods – and the pivot away from ultra-processed foods – means greater access to healthier options for America's most vulnerable, she added.</p><p>"[The system] is rigged against us, but by taking agency ourselves and having a little help from HHS, we can get there."</p><p><a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO JOIN FOX NATION</u></strong></a></p><p>Michaels has echoed concerns from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/maha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAHA movement</a>, calling out the American food system and its benefactors, who she alleges are exposing the public to harmful chemicals that could be driving the health crisis. </p><p>To learn more about the food-illness relationship, subscribe to Fox Nation and begin streaming <a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Toxic: America’s Food Crisis."</a></p>
