<p>Long-serving Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/amy-klobuchar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.,</a> indicated that she is giving serious consideration to mounting a gubernatorial bid.</p><p>"I love my job, I love my state and I’m seriously considering it," the lawmaker <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/politics/amy-klobuchar-tim-walz-minnesota-governor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">told CNN.</a></p><p>Current Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> mounted a re-election bid last year, but he later announced on Monday that he was dropping out of the race. His reversal comes amid the massive fraud scandal unfolding in the state linked to the Somali community. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-republicans-say-tim-walz-not-off-hook-after-dropping-re-election-bid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>MINNESOTA REPUBLICANS SAY TIM WALZ NOT OFF THE HOOK AFTER DROPPING RE-ELECTION BID</strong></a></p><p>"In September, I announced that I would run for a historic third term as Minnesota's governor. And I have every confidence that, if I gave it my all, I would succeed in that effort," he said in a <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/#/detail/appId/1/id/718148" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a>.</p><p>"But as I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all. Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences. So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work," he noted.</p><p>Klobuchar, who has served in the U.S. Senate since early 2007, called Walz "a true public servant" in a <a href="https://x.com/amyklobuchar/status/2008231296254779726" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post on X.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/james-comer-accuse-tim-walz-being-asleep-wheel-fraud-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JAMES COMER TO ACCUSE TIM WALZ OF BEING ‘ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL’ AT FRAUD HEARING</strong></a></p><p>Walz's announcement came after independent journalist Nick Shirley's reporting about alleged <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/minnesota-fraud-exposed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive fraud</a> linked to taxpayer-funded daycare facilities in the state went viral.</p><p>But the governor asserted on Tuesday that he will not resign from office.</p><p>"I'm not goin' anywhere," he asserted. "And you can make all your requests for me to resign over my dead body will that happen."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p><p>Walz ran as then-Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during the 2024 presidential election.</p>
