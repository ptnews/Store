For United Nations entities, withdrawal means ceasing participation in or funding to the extent permitted by law.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-unloads-alarmists-touts-state-dept-disaster-response-after-usaid-closure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>RUBIO UNLOADS ON ‘ALARMISTS,’ TOUTS STATE DEPT DISASTER RESPONSE AFTER USAID CLOSURE</u></strong></a></p><p>The administration framed the move as part of Trump’s broader "America First" agenda aimed at restoring American sovereignty and ending taxpayer support for organizations it views as wasteful, ineffective or contrary to U.S. interests. </p><p>Review of additional international organizations remains ongoing, according to the White House.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/secretary-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Secretary of State</u></a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Marco Rubio</u></a> said the withdrawals fulfill a key commitment of Trump’s presidency.</p><p>"Today, President Trump announced the U.S. is leaving 66 anti-American, useless, or wasteful international organizations," Rubio said in a post on X.

"The days of billions of dollars in taxpayer money flowing to foreign interests at the expense of our people are over."</p><p>The list includes organizations involved in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>areas such as climate</u></a>, energy, development, governance, migration and gender policy, according to the White House. The White House published the full list alongside the order.</p><p>Rubio said the withdrawals reflect a shift in how the administration views international engagement.</p><p>"We will not continue expending resources, diplomatic capital, and the legitimizing weight of our participation in institutions that are irrelevant to or in conflict with our interests," Rubio said. "We seek <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>cooperation where it serves our people</u></a> and will stand firm where it does not."</p><p>The White House and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Department</a> did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.</p>
