<p>Dylan Mulvaney is responding after backlash to being cast as Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII, in Broadway’s "<a href="https://sixonbroadway.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Six the Musical</a>." The transgender activist called the opportunity a "miracle," as backlash over the casting led the show to lock down its social media.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/musicals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The musical</a> has been marketed as a feminist-pop celebration of women’s history and "21st century girl power." Mulvaney’s casting sparked debate online, with critics arguing the women-centered production sidelined female performers by casting the influencer as Anne Boleyn.</p><p>The backlash grew intense enough to prompt the show to restrict its social media presence. The production <a href="https://x.com/sixbroadway?s=21" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">locked its X account</a>, making it inaccessible to non-followers, and disabled comments on Instagram posts announcing Mulvaney’s casting.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jk-rowling-slams-glamour-uks-women-year-cover-featuring-nine-trans-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>JK ROWLING SLAMS GLAMOUR UK'S WOMEN OF THE YEAR COVER FEATURING NINE TRANS WOMEN</u></strong></a></p><p>Mulvaney addressed the controversy as part of her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTshkftjkYP/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"Days of Girlhood"</a> video series on social media, which documents her gender transition.</p><p>"Being a trans person in 2026 when this world is working against us in what feels like every way," Mulvaney said in a minutes-long video message posted online.</p><p>"For me to be able to step out onto a Broadway stage as Anne Boleyn and perform an iconic historical character's role in a show that is so rooted in celebrating femininity, I think that's a miracle," she added, noting Monday was the first rehearsal for the show.</p><p>Mulvaney also acknowledged the "privilege" that helped secure the role and briefly referenced the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bud-light-backlash-figure-dylan-mulvaney-joins-women-centered-broadway-musical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bud Light controversy</a> that made her a national figure. In April 2023, Mulvaney posted videos showing that Bud Light sent her a pack of beer featuring her face.</p><p>In January 2024, FOX Business reported that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/drinks/beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bud Light sales</a> fell nearly 30% in the months following the campaign. The backlash became one of the most prominent corporate culture clashes in recent years, with Bud Light ultimately losing its position as<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/experts-break-down-how-bud-light-reportedly-lost-top-selling-beer-status-betrayal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> America’s top-selling beer</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/how-anheuser-busch-lost-its-way-dei-according-former-executive" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>HOW ANHEUSER-BUSCH LOST ITS WAY WITH DEI, ACCORDING TO A FORMER EXECUTIVE</u></strong></a></p><p>"If I had to go viral and find myself in a far-right media firestorm and spend many years and many tears wondering why that was happening and trying desperately to get back to what I once loved, which was theater, I would do it all over again if it meant that I got to be on stage," Mulvaney added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/boy-georges-criminal-past-gets-called-out-j-k-rowling-after-picking-fight-transgender-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BOY GEORGE'S CRIMINAL PAST GETS CALLED OUT BY JK ROWLING AFTER PICKING FIGHT ON TRANSGENDER RIGHTS</strong></a></p><p>Supporters of the casting have argued that the musical was never meant to be historically accurate, accusing critics of transphobia.
