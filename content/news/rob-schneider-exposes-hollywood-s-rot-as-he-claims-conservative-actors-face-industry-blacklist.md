<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rob-schneider-wants-messy-conversations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob Schneider</a> is speaking out against what he calls the "rot in the soul of Hollywood."</p><p>The actor says Hollywood is "dismantling itself," and part of the problem is the "blacklisting" of conservative celebrities.</p><p>Schneider, known for his stint on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/saturday-night-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Saturday Night Live"</a> and for movies like "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo" and "The Hot Chick," said in a recent interview that when he started publicly talking about his right-leaning political views, his acting opportunities went out the window.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rob-schneider-defends-free-speech-amid-uc-berkeley-protest-shares-tense-moment-robert-de-niro" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ROB SCHNEIDER DEFENDS FREE SPEECH AMID UC BERKELEY PROTEST, SHARES TENSE MOMENT WITH ROBERT DE NIRO</strong></a></p><p>"That was it for me starring in movies," he explained on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1ok4EWsnsU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"American Thought Leaders"</a> podcast.</p><p>"The act of telling the truth in an age of authoritarianism, in an age of lies, is a courageous act," he continued. "And I'm not saying that I'm courageous. When I think of real courage, I think of… in any major city, the cemeteries of people who gave their, what Lincoln describes, the last full measure of their devotion for this great land."</p><p>He added, "That is a sacrifice. I mean, the fact that I'll never make ‘Deuce Bigalow’ 4, 5 and 6, I think is fine."</p><p>Schneider laughed at the comparison of the two, but he did admit that the impact his views have had on his career is "a bummer."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

"You know, they don't want you being mouthy or anything, and that makes sense, but I do think that at a certain point, if we're going to have a society and if we're going to continue to have a free society, it's going to require people to step up and be courageous."</p><p>He said the First Amendment does allow for this kind of courage, but acknowledged that freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences – "you can ask Jimmy Kimmel," he quipped, referencing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/sinclair-ends-jimmy-kimmel-ban-after-sidelining-host-amid-charlie-kirk-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kimmel's brief suspension</a> in September 2025 after his comments on the assassination of Charlie Kirk.</p><p>"It's going to cost you," Schneider admitted.</p><p>He gave <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/charlton-heston-son-fraser-heston-tells-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlton Heston</a> as an example: a legendary actor and an early supporter of the civil rights movement who was later "rejected by the liberal intelligentsia because he just happened to be a conservative."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>"I think that's shameful," he admitted. "I think that's a rot in the soul of Hollywood. And I think today's blacklisting of conservatives is the same thing. I think, at its core, it is adding to its destruction. And I think we are seeing Hollywood completely dismantle itself."</p><p>Schneider believes that in five years, many major film studios in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/los-angeles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles</a> "will just be real estate," and instead of leaning on Hollywood movies for entertainment, audiences will increasingly turn to watching videos on social media instead of films.</p><p>"I think you're going to see – you're seeing right now – a rejection of Hollywood… you're seeing an implosion of it."</p>
