<p>The sister of Robert Pearson, who was killed in a Washington State highway crash, says her family has been unable to find legal representation to pursue accountability against the state entity that issued a commercial driver's license (CDL) to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">undocumented immigrant truck driver</a> who allegedly struck and killed her brother.</p><p>Jen Jensen, Pearson’s sister, said her family had begun taking legal action against the trucking company that hired Singh, but holding government agencies to account has proven more difficult.</p><p>"Where they're running into problems is suing Washington, suing California, the company that issued the CDL," Jensen said Wednesday on "The Ingraham Angle."</p><p>"That's where they're running into problems of finding a lawyer that's willing to take case and wanting to put up a fight, because there are so many layers to this. It's not, unfortunately, this clean case that... it seems like."</p><p>Kamalpreet Singh was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents after crossing illegally into the United States on Dec. 23, 2023, but was released into the country instead of being detained, an ICE source said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrant-caught-released-biden-administration-now-charged-washington-vehicular-homicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singh faces charges of vehicular homicide</a> after he allegedly crashed into the back of a vehicle on State Route 167 in Washington, crushing it between another truck and killing 29-year-old Robert B.
