<p>Nail-biting, procrastination and avoidance are often framed as bad habits we can't control, but a new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychology book</a> argues that they’re more like survival strategies that may have once protected us.</p><p>In "Controlled Explosions in Mental Health," clinical psychologist Dr. Charlie Heroot-Maitland examined why people stick with bad habits that seem to work against their own best interest.</p><p>Drawing on years of clinical research and therapeutic practice, the expert reveals how the brain prioritizes predictability and safety over comfort and happiness.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/happiness-expert-shares-6-step-morning-routine-boosts-mood-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HAPPINESS EXPERT SHARES 6-STEP MORNING ROUTINE THAT BOOSTS MOOD AND PRODUCTIVITY</strong></a></p><p>"Our <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain is a survival machine</a>," he told Fox News Digital. "It is programmed not to optimize our happiness and well-being, but to keep us alive."</p><p>For much of human history, being caught off-guard could be fatal, research shows. "The brain prefers predictable pain over unpredictable threat," Heriot-Maitland said. "It does not like surprises."</p><p>When faced with uncertainty, the brain may opt for smaller, self-sabotaging behaviors rather than risking larger, unpredictable ones.</p><p>The book argues that "the brain uses these small harms as a protective dose to prevent further harms." Procrastination, for example, may create stress and frustration, but it can also delay exposure to the higher-stakes fear of failure or judgment.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/creative-hobbies-keep-brain-young-study-finds-here-best-ones-pursue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CREATIVE HOBBIES KEEP THE BRAIN YOUNG, STUDY FINDS — HERE ARE THE BEST ONES TO PURSUE</strong></a></p><p>"The central argument is that behaviors we label as ‘self‑sabotaging’ could actually be attempts <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by the brain</a> to control discomfort," Thea Gallagher, a psychologist and wellness programs director at NYU Langone Health, told Fox News Digital. </p><p>In modern life, threats are often <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more emotional</a> than physical. Rejection, shame, anxiety and loss of control can activate the same survival systems as a physical threat, experts say.</p><p>"Our brains have evolved to favor perceiving threat, even when there isn't one, in order to elicit a protective response in us," Heriot-Maitland said.</p><p>Self-criticism, avoidance and actions like nail-biting can function as attempts to manage the "dangers."</p><p>Gallagher noted that the book leans on clinical insight rather than empirical research.</p><p>"That doesn’t make it wrong, but it means the claims are more interpretive than scientific," she said, noting that more data is needed to determine what is happening on a "mechanistic level."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-study-reveals-how-chewing-gum-affects-brain-function-mental-activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STUDY REVEALS WHY CHEWING GUM MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP WITH FOCUS AND STRESS RELIEF</strong></a></p><p>Gallagher also emphasized that external factors, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/education/adhd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as ADHD</a>, trauma, chronic stress or socioeconomic pressures, can shape these behaviors in ways that aren’t just about threat responses.</p><p>Rather than seeing patterns like procrastination as flaws, the book encourages people to understand their protective function. That said, people should seek <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional support</a> for destructive behaviors that could cause severe distress or self-harm.</p><p>"I encourage my patients to think about short-term pain for long-term gain, because if you just respond to discomfort and distress in the moment, you might find yourself in longer-term patterns you don’t like or want," Gallagher said.</p><p>"I don’t think it explains the motivations for all people, as everyone is different, but I think it can certainly apply to some."</p><p>Heriot-Maitland noted that everyone has a choice in how they handle their own potentially harmful habits.</p><p>"We don't want to fight these behaviors, but nor do we want to appease them and let them carry on controlling, dictating and sabotaging our lives," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>Gallagher shared the following practical tips for people who may notice these patterns.</p><p>Instead of asking yourself "Why am I like this?" try focusing on the function of the behavior, she advised. For example, does it serve to soothe, numb or distract from other fears or threats?</p><p>"Observing the behavior with curiosity helps weaken the automatic threat response," Gallagher said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>This can mean relying on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/techniques" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grounding techniques</a>, supportive relationships, predictable routines and self‑soothing practices.</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"If the brain fears uncertainty, gently introducing controlled uncertainty can help retrain it," the expert recommended.</p>
