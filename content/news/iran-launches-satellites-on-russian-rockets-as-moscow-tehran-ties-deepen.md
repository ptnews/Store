<p>While the United States presses for negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, Russia is signaling a parallel strategy — deepening cooperation with U.S. adversaries and portraying itself as resistant to Western pressure.</p><p>That posture was on display this week when Iran announced that three of its domestically designed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space/spaceflight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">satellites were launched</a> into orbit aboard a Russian rocket.</p><p>The launch was broadcast by Iran’s Arabic-language state television channel Al-Alam News Network, which aired footage showing the satellites lifting off from Russian territory. The Associated Press and Reuters reported that the satellites were carried into orbit aboard a Russian rocket launched from eastern Russia, marking the seventh time Iran has conducted a satellite launch with Russian assistance.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-president-says-country-total-war-us-israel-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong><u>IRANIAN PRESIDENT SAYS HIS COUNTRY IS AT 'TOTAL WAR' WITH THE US, ISRAEL AND EUROPE: REPORTS</u></strong></a></p><p>Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali said the satellites were "designed and produced by Iranian scientists," adding that cooperation between Tehran and Moscow continues "despite all the sanctions and threats," according to Iranian state media cited by Reuters.</p><p>Iranian officials claim the satellites are intended for civilian purposes, including environmental monitoring and agriculture, though Western governments have long warned that Iran’s space program could advance technologies applicable to ballistic missile development.</p><p>The launch underscored a broader strategic relationship between <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moscow</a> that has expanded significantly since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Iran has supplied Russia with drones and other military equipment used on the battlefield, while Russia has provided diplomatic cover, economic cooperation and advanced technical support amid sweeping Western sanctions on both countries.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-reportedly-developing-chemical-biological-missile-warheads-protests-spread-over-collapsing-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong><u>IRAN REPORTEDLY DEVELOPING CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL MISSILE WARHEADS AS PROTESTS SPREAD OVER COLLAPSING ECONOMY</u></strong></a></p><p>The growing Russia-Iran alignment comes as tensions between Tehran and Washington continue to rise. After President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> recently warned that the United States could strike Iran again if it attempted to rebuild its nuclear program, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian issued a sharp response.</p><p>According to the Associated Press, Pezeshkian said any U.S. attack would be met with a "harsh and discouraging" response. Iranian officials framed the warning as defensive, arguing it was meant to deter potential U.S. aggression rather than signal an intention to initiate conflict. Tehran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is peaceful, a claim the United States and its allies dispute.</p><p>The exchange highlights how Iran and Russia are increasingly positioning themselves as partners pushing back against U.S. pressure, even as Washington attempts to pursue diplomacy on multiple fronts. Russia has portrayed its partnerships with Iran and other sanctioned states as evidence that Western efforts to isolate Moscow have failed, while Iran has used its cooperation with Russia to showcase technological resilience under sanctions.</p>
