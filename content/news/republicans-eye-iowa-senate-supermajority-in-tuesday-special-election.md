<p>Democrats’ last sliver of leverage in Iowa’s Senate is on the line Tuesday, with Republicans poised to seize a supermajority that would let GOP leaders govern with little resistance.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/iowa-police-chiefs-son-among-national-guard-members-killed-syria-isis-terrorist-attack"><strong>IOWA’S POLICE CHIEF’S SON AMONG NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS KILLED IN SYRIA ISIS TERRORIST ATTACK</strong></a></p><p>Renee Hardman, the Democratic candidate, will face off against Republican Lucas Loftin in a race for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/iowa">Iowa</a> Senate District 16 to fill the seat of the late Sen. Claire Celsi, who died of undisclosed medical complications in October. </p><p>Celsi, a Democrat, had held a seat in Iowa’s Senate since 2019.</p><p>With control of two-thirds of the chamber, Republican Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/r/gov-kim-reynolds">Kim Reynolds</a> could more easily push through her appointments to state agencies. Without it, she requires the help of at least one Democrat to confirm her nominations.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-gop-senator-steps-up-efforts-protect-republican-majority-2026-midterms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TOP GOP SENATOR STEPS UP EFFORTS TO PROTECT REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN 2026 MIDTERMS</strong></a></p><p>That lone vote provides Democrats with a rare level of power in the Hawkeye State. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/democratic-party">Democrats,</a> now in danger of losing their foothold in the Senate, also find themselves dwarfed in the state’s House of Representatives, where Republicans hold 66 of the chamber’s 100 seats.
