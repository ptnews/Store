<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) delivered good news for America’s troops Friday, confirming that the one-time $1,776 "Warrior Dividend" paid to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service members</a> in December 2025 is completely tax-free, allowing troops to keep every dollar of the bonus.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-supplemental-basic-allowance-for-housing-payments-to-members-of-the-military-are-not-taxable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Friday release</a>, the Treasury Department and the IRS said that "supplemental basic allowance for housing payments" made to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/armed-forces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members of the uniformed services</a> in December 2025 "are not to be included in income by those who received the payments; they are not taxable."</p><p>The agency said federal tax law specifically excludes from gross income a "qualified military benefit," adding that basic allowances for housing payments fall under that category and therefore are not subject to federal income taxes.</p><p>The confirmation caps off President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>’s pre-Christmas announcement that nearly 1.5 million U.S. service members would receive a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/military-troops-get-special-christmas-gift-president-says-warrior-dividend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special "Warrior Dividend"</a> in recognition of their service and to commemorate roughly 250 years since the nation’s founding.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-unveils-900b-defense-bill-targeting-china-tech-bans-investment-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CONGRESS UNVEILS $900B DEFENSE BILL TARGETING CHINA WITH TECH BANS, INVESTMENT CRACKDOWN, US TROOP PAY RAISE</strong></a></p><p>"And the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-bringing-country-back-from-brink-ruin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checks are already on the way</a>," Trump said during a Dec. 17, 2025, primetime address from the White House, crediting tariffs and recently passed GOP spending and tax legislation for funding the payments. </p><p>"Nobody deserves it more than our military. And I say congratulations to everybody," he added.</p><p>According to the IRS, Congress appropriated $2.9 billion in legislation enacted last July to supplement the basic allowance for housing payable to members of the uniformed services, with the one-time $1,776 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hand-out-2-6b-warrior-dividends-surprising-pot-hes-pulling-money-from" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payments</a> funded by that appropriation.</p><p>The IRS said the supplemental payments were made primarily to active-duty service members in pay grades O-6 and below, along with eligible Reserve Component members as of Nov. 30, 2025, across the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Space Force.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-medal-honor-act-raise-pensions-americas-military-heroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP SIGNS 'MEDAL OF HONOR ACT' TO RAISE PENSIONS FOR AMERICA'S MILITARY HEROES</strong></a></p><p>Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson welcomed the tax treatment in remarks carried by <a href="https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4382089/1776-warrior-dividend-tax-free-irs-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pentagon News</a>, saying the ruling ensures the money reaches military families directly.</p><p>"The tax-free Warrior Dividend places $1,776 directly in the hands of our <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/military-families" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warfighters and their families</a>," Wilson said.
