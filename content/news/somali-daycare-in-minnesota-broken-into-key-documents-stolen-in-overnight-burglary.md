He believes the incident occurred between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/somali-minnesotans-being-scapegoated-fraud-investigation-nyt-writer-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>SOMALI MINNESOTANS BEING 'SCAPEGOATED' IN FRAUD INVESTIGATION, NYT WRITER CLAIMS</u></strong></a></p><p>A door to the building was damaged, he said. The Minneapolis Police Department confirmed the break-in to Fox News Digital.</p><p>A video taken by <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/somali-day-care-minneapolis-vandalized-dec-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox Minneapolis</a> shows portions of a wall gutted. The building appeared to have a security camera on its exterior. It wasn't clear if the cameras recorded footage of what happened.  </p><p>In addition to vandalism, the suspect or suspects took documents related to employees and children at the daycare, Mohamed said.</p><p>He cited a viral video posted online by independent journalist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/shirley-associate-viral-video-says-filed-criminal-complaint-against-walz-over-daycare-fraud-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Shirley</a>, who visited nearly a dozen daycare facilities while seeking evidence of fraud, for the daycare being targeted. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-slammed-wake-viral-video-raises-daycare-funding-questions-held-accountable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>WALZ SLAMMED IN WAKE OF VIRAL VIDEO THAT RAISES DAYCARE FUNDING QUESTIONS: 'NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'</u></strong></a></p><p>The 42-minute video, posted online last week, garnered millions of views and quickly went viral, drawing the attention of President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other administration officials.</p><p>"This is devastating news, and we don’t know why this is targeting our <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somali community</a>, as one video made by a specific individual made this all happen," Mohamed said.</p><p>He claimed the daycare has received "hateful" and "threatening" messages over the past several days.</p><p>"This is frightening and exhausting," he said.</p><p>Nokomis Daycare Center was operating in good standing and is licensed to care for up to 71 children, including infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, according to the Minnesota Department of Human Services (MDHS) website. </p><p>The center had two violations in October for menus that failed to comply with the nutritional requirements set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and missing documentation to show that a teacher met qualifications. Both violations were corrected, the MDHS said. </p><p>The day care center was not one of the facilities featured in Shirley’s video.</p><p>The video surfaced amid widespread fraud allegations, up to $1 billion, in Minnesota. Federal prosecutors have already indicted and charged dozens of people in connection with the alleged fraudulent activity.</p><p>The Trump administration has also begun investigating suspected fraud in the city.
