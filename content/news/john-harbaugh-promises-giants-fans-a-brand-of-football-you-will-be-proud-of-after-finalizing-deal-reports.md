Offensive coordinator Mike Kafka was named interim coach and went 2-5 in his seven games.</p><p>Daboll was in his fourth season and compiled a 20-40-1 record. He was named NFL Coach of the Year in his first season after leading the Giants to a 9-7-1 record and a playoff berth, but the team’s record worsened in every season.</p><p>While Kafka won his last two games and received an interview for the full-time position, he did not get the job. </p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
