<p>Former first lady <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michelle-obama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelle Obama</a> is doubling down on her belief that America is not prepared to elect a woman president, arguing that voters continue to hold <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential" target="_blank" rel="noopener">female candidates</a> to higher standards than men.</p><p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CGYpWS4a6E" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"Call Her Daddy" podcast</a>, Obama warned Democrats against denying that sexism still plays a role in national elections. She pointed to former Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/hillary-clinton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hillary Clinton</a> and former Vice President Kamala Harris as examples.</p><p>"We would just be silly to think that there aren’t just some gut kind of, I don’t know, like, we’re not even analyzing what those feelings are about because we’re trying to pretend like it’s all better," Obama said in the episode released Wednesday.</p><p>"There are men out there that were not [going to] vote for a woman," she later added.</p><p>She said many attitudes toward women remain "deeply embedded" in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American culture</a>, raising questions about whether enough voters believe they can follow a woman president.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-swipes-michelle-obamas-bad-attitude-saying-america-ready-woman-president" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILL MAHER SWIPES MICHELLE OBAMA'S 'BAD ATTITUDE' FOR SAYING AMERICA ISN'T READY FOR A WOMAN PRESIDENT</strong></a></p><p>Obama has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michelle-obama-says-america-not-ready-woman-president-we-saw-past-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made similar remarks</a> before. During a previous appearance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, she told a crowd of women that the country was "not ready" for a woman to lead.</p><p>She addressed criticism of that claim, saying, "Let’s not be mad because I made the statement."</p><p>"Let’s look at the fact that we’ve had two really qualified female candidates," said Obama, referencing both Clinton and Harris, who lost their bids for the White House.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/michelle-obama-says-we-have-pick-leaders-dont-rob-women-femininity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS 'WE HAVE TO PICK LEADERS' WHO DON'T ROB WOMEN OF THEIR FEMININITY</strong></a></p><p>Obama argued that female candidates are <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held to a higher standard</a> by the public and are seen as falling short if they are not "perfect." She called on her party to stop "pretending" that isn’t the case.  </p><p>But not all Democratic women agree. Michigan Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gretchen-whitmer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gretchen Whitmer</a> said she believes the nation is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gov-whitmer-says-america-ready-woman-president-contrasting-michelle-obama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready for a woman president</a>. She pushed back against the former first lady’s comments during an interview with NPR released Tuesday.</p><p>"I think America is ready for a woman president," Whitmer said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/obama-presidential-center-breaks-silence-over-controversial-building-design"><strong>OBAMA PRESIDENTIAL CENTER BREAKS SILENCE OVER CONTROVERSIAL BUILDING DESIGN</strong></a></p><p>"The question comes down to a choice between two people, and what we saw in this last election, while Kamala Harris didn't beat President Trump, we saw women get elected across the country."</p><p>"We saw women win up and down the ballot in hard, important states to win, so I do think there’s an appetite," she added.</p><p>"I just, for whatever reason, we have not had a woman president yet. I think we will at some point in the near future."</p>
