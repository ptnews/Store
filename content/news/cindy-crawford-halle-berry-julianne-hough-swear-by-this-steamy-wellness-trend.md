<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cindy-crawford-daughter-kaia-gerber-prove-model-genes-run-family-glamorous-gala" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cindy Crawford,</a> Julianne Hough and Halle Berry are among the celebrities who are turning up the heat in their wellness routines amid the rising trend of infrared and traditional sauna use. </p><p>Over the past few years, an increasing number of stars have spoken out about the health and beauty benefits that they have experienced from frequent sauna sessions. </p><p>As the New Year dawns, here's a look at the stars who are using Hollywood's hottest self-care hack. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dancing-stars-host-julianne-hough-strips-down-after-firing-back-concerns-over-her-body" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julianne Hough</a> has previously <i>s</i>hared steamy glimpses of herself in saunas on Instagram. In early December, the 37-year-old "Dancing with the Stars" co-host uploaded a photo on her Instagram Story in which she was seen wearing a mustard yellow string bikini while relaxing in a sauna. Hough added a yellow heart emoji to the snap that she shared with her fans. </p><p>.<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/landman-star-ali-larter-reveals-430-a-m-workout-routine-diet-secrets-paramount-role" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'LANDMAN' STAR ALI LARTER REVEALS 4:30 A.M. WORKOUT ROUTINE AND DIET SECRETS </strong></a></p><p>In June 2024, Hough posted a video with the caption "Six Senses Sizzling Sauna Stretches" that was taken during a vacation at Ibiza's Six Senses Resort in Spain. In the clip shared on Instagram, she displayed her fit physique in a brown string bikini while showing off a series of stretching and Pilates moves. </p><p>Following her sauna session, Hough shared a video of herself in a cold plunge bath, also known as an ice bath. In the caption, she explained how <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contrast therapy</a> has benefited her active lifestyle and recovery. </p><p>Contrast therapy treatment involves alternating between hot and cold temperatures to stimulate circulation and reduce inflammation. The rapid temperature changes are known to relax muscles, decrease soreness and promote overall physical and mental recovery.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/C76VbpNuQYb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW POST </strong></a></p><p>"I’ve been doing ice baths since 2015 when I was touring the country on stage for 2.5 hrs almost every night," Hough wrote in the caption. "In 2014, I had the worst neck injury the whole tour that I just couldn’t fathom the pain and pure survival mode again verses being able to fully enjoy being on stage night after night. So I committed and never looked back!"</p><p>"The amount of recovery I have spent on my body in my later years of life would’ve been much less if I had known about the benefits of contrast therapy earlier," she explained. </p><p>Hough concluded her post by sharing her best tips for those who want to try contrast therapy.</p><p>"If you feel the water is hurting your toes or fingers, you can wear booties/gloves or like I do, I hold my fingers out of the water," she wrote.</p><p>"Another hint: pick a song that you LOVE that’s around the length that you want to stay in so you can groove to it. My go to songs are 6’s to 9’s and Calm Down."</p><p>Cindy Crawford owns her own <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infrared sauna</a> and has previously spoken out about how regular sessions are essential to her wellness routine. </p><p>In 2015, the 59-year-old supermodel told Byrdie, "I try to go into an infrared sauna for 20 minutes at least once a week. Before I invested in my own, I just went to a local tanning salon that also had an infrared sauna — my homeopathic doctor suggested I get one because it’s good for detoxing." </p><p>"It’s not like a normal sauna, which can be harsh," Crawford added. "Instead, infrared is a super gentle, soothing, and therapeutic heat that helps me relax and improves my sleep (and we all know how much I value sleep). It also works somewhat like a Japanese hot spring in that it stimulates collagen production to reduce wrinkles, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve overall skin tone</a>, and improve circulation. </p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/Coxz2Kvr1KH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>APP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW POST </strong></a></p><p>"Another added benefit? Twenty minutes of uninterrupted time to read!"</p><p>In August, Crawford shared a glimpse at one of her favorite pastimes, posting a photo in which she was seen topless and makeup free while reading a book in a sauna. </p><p>"Sauna time and a good book = perfect morning," she wrote in the caption.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bachelor-couple-sean-catherine-lowe-push-back-ozempic-craze-theres-healthier-route" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'BACHELOR' COUPLE SEAN AND CATHERINE LOWE PUSH BACK ON OZEMPIC CRAZE: ‘THERE'S A HEALTHIER ROUTE’ </strong></a></p><p>In 2023, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cindy-crawford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vogue cover star </a>uploaded an Instagram video of herself playing with short strands of hair around her forehead while sweating it out in a sauna.</p><p>"Baby hairs in the sauna," she wrote in the caption. </p><p>Kim Kardashian celebrated her love for saunas as she posted photos of herself enjoying a session in 2023.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kim-kardashians-brain-scan-uncovers-troubling-holes-causing-low-activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45-year-old reality star</a> shared images of herself rocking a black string bikini as she posed with a friend in a sauna.
