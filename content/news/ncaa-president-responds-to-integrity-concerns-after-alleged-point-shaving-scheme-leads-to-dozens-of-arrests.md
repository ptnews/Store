We are thankful for law enforcement agencies working to detect and combat integrity issues and match manipulation in college sports," NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement.</p><p>Baker said the indictments were "not entirely new information to the NCAA," as it had conducted "integrity investigations into approximately 40 student-athletes from 20 schools over the past year."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/federal-prosecutors-indict-allegedly-fixing-college-basketball-games-widespread-conspiracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FEDERAL PROSECUTORS INDICT 26 PEOPLE FOR ALLEGEDLY FIXING COLLEGE BASKETBALL GAMES IN WIDESPREAD CONSPIRACY</strong></a></p><p>The NCAA added that 11 athletes from seven schools were "recently found to have bet on their own performances, shared information with known bettors, and/or engaged in game manipulation to collect on bets they — or others — placed" and have since been permanently banned.</p><p>"Additionally, 13 student-athletes from eight schools (including some of those identified above) were found to have failed to cooperate in the sports betting integrity investigation by providing false or misleading information, failing to provide relevant documentation and/or refusing to be interviewed by the enforcement staff. None of them are competing today," Baker added.</p><p>Baker also called on states to crack down on "threats to integrity," specifically prop bets, "to better protect athletes and leagues from integrity risks and predatory bettors. We also will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement. We urge all student-athletes to make well-informed choices to avoid jeopardizing the game and their eligibility."</p><p>The chargers on Thursday included bribery in sporting contests, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and wire fraud.</p><p>"[Defendants] aided and abetted the carrying into effect, the attempt to carry into effect, and the conspiracy to carry into effect, a scheme in commerce to influence by bribery sporting contests, that is, Chinese Basketball Association ("CBA") men's basketball games and National Collegiate Athletic Association ("NCAA") men's basketball games, with the defendants engaging in different aspects of this scheme, with knowledge that the purpose of this scheme was to influence in some way those contests by bribery," the indictment said.</p><p>The announcement follows the federal government’s crackdown on illicit sports gambling and point-shaving schemes that involved the NBA in October.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
