<p>Swiss authorities on Friday began the grim task of identifying the mostly young victims of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/fires" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>deadly New Year’s Eve bar fire</u></a> that killed around 40 people and injured more than 100 at a ski resort in Crans-Montana.</p><p>Italian authorities said the death toll could be as high as 47, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-face-arduous-task-identifying-victims-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-01/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters reported</a>, citing information provided by Swiss officials. Several Italian nationals were reportedly among the dead, injured or still missing.</p><p>The fire tore through the Le Constellation bar in the Alpine resort town in the early hours Thursday, turning a packed night of celebration into panic and tragedy.
