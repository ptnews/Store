<p>Swiss authorities on Friday began the grim task of identifying the mostly young victims of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/fires" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>deadly New Year’s Eve bar fire</u></a> that killed around 40 people and injured 119 revelers at a ski resort in Crans-Montana.</p><p>It appears the fire started from sparkler candles, which were placed on top of champagne bottles and were taken too close to the ceiling during bottle service, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said at a press conference on Friday. The flames triggered a violent ignition of combustible gases known as a flashover, causing the flames to spread suddenly and violently, Pilloud said. </p><p>"We will be able to investigate whether any individuals bear criminal liability for this incident," Pilloud said. "And if this is the case and if these people are alive, all the investigations will be opened for fire by negligence, homicide by negligence and injuries by negligence."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hong-kong-leader-says-we-must-uncover-truth-deadly-apartment-fire-calls-building-reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>HONG KONG LEADER SAYS 'WE MUST UNCOVER THE TRUTH' AFTER DEADLY APARTMENT FIRE, CALLS FOR BUILDING REFORM</u></strong></a></p><p>Italian authorities said the death toll could be as high as 47, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-face-arduous-task-identifying-victims-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-01/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters reported</a>, citing information provided by Swiss officials.
