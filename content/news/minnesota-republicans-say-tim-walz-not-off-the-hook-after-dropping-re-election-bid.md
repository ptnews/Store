<p>Minnesota lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives applauded Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz">Tim Walz’s</a> decision to not pursue re-election but doubled down on demands for accountability.</p><p>"Governor Walz's decision to not seek re-election is the only acceptable outcome after the large-scale fraud that was permitted under his watch," Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., said. </p><p>Fischbach, a member of the powerful House Rules Committee, previously served as lieutenant governor of the North Star State in 2018. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/nick-shirley-gloats-he-ended-tim-walz-after-minnesota-governor-scraps-re-election-bid-amid-fraud-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NICK SHIRLEY GLOATS HE 'ENDED TIM WALZ’ AFTER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR SCRAPS RE-ELECTION BID AMID FRAUD SCANDAL</strong></a></p><p>"His career is ending because Walz and the Democrats allowed Minnesota to become a national playground for fraudsters, and his radical negligence has cost Minnesotans billions," Fischbach said.</p><p>Minnesota first elected Walz as governor in 2018 and then re-elected him in 2022. Walz ran briefly for the White House as a part of Vice President Kamala Harris’ ticket in 2024, but after he was unsuccessful, he announced plans to pursue a third term as governor.</p><p>His decision to drop out of that race comes as new revelations about fraud in Minnesota show the state could have lost <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/magnitude-cannot-overstated-feds-say-minnesota-fraud-may-more-than-9b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much as $9 billion</a> under Walz’s leadership through abuse of its government assistance programs.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-tim-walzs-white-guilt-finally-ends-his-career-minnesotas-fraud-explodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DAVID MARCUS: TIM WALZ'S WHITE GUILT FINALLY ENDS HIS CAREER AS MINNESOTA’S FRAUD EXPLODES</strong></a></p><p>In recent months, investigators have discovered sweeping fraud schemes masquerading as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/unearthed-surveillance-exposes-how-parents-allegedly-involved-minnesotas-daycare-fraud-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daycare centers,</a> medical providers, food assistance programs and more. By fabricating services or misrepresenting the number of people they claimed to serve, the schemes siphoned billions in government funds.</p><p>Walz’s current term ends in January 2027. Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., believes it should end sooner.</p><p>"Governor Walz's decision not to seek re-election doesn't let him off the hook," Stauber said. "Minnesotans deserve to see full accountability. Under Tim Walz’s leadership, at least $9 billion was stolen from taxpayers by fraudsters, the state’s $18 billion surplus was squandered, taxes were increased by $10 billion and illegal immigrants were given free college, health care and driver’s licenses." </p><p>"If Walz is unfit to seek re-election, he is unfit to serve as governor. The news this morning should have been ‘Tim Walz resigns,’" Stauber added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/comer-warns-walz-absence-minnesota-fraud-hearing-would-admission-guilt-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COMER WARNS WALZ ABSENCE AT MINNESOTA FRAUD HEARING WOULD BE 'ADMISSION TO GUILT' BY GOVERNOR</strong></a></p><p>With an eye toward the future, Rep. Brad Finstad, R-Minn., lamented that the fraud rings in Minnesota would take time to unwind and that the state would have a long road ahead toward healing.</p><p>"Unfortunately, it will take years to undo the damage he has done to the state of Minnesota. The next Governor of Minnesota will have a massive task ahead of them to root out systemic waste, fraud and abuse. I am committed to working with my fellow Minnesotans to ensure we elect a Republican governor who will restore trust in state government and the reputation of our great state," Finstad said <a href="https://x.com/BradFinstad/status/2008216599753347325" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in a post to X.</a></p><p>Despite Walz’s announcement, Fischbach said that Republican efforts to investigate fraud and abuse in Minnesota would continue.</p><p>"The era of looking the other way is over. Minnesota Democrats: Take note. We are coming for accountability and will continue to investigate until every stolen dollar is accounted for," Fischbach said. </p>
