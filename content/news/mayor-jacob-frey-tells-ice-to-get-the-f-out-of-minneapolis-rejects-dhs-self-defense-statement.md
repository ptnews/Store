<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minneapolis Mayor</a> Jacob Frey on Wednesday told federal immigration authorities to "get the f---" out of the city following the fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE officer during an enforcement operation. </p><p>The Department of Homeland Security said authorities were conducting an operation when rioters began blocking ICE vehicles. The driver of one vehicle allegedly attempted to "weaponize her vehicle" to hit law enforcement officials in what they described as an act of "domestic terrorism."</p><p>The woman was confirmed dead at a local hospital, officials said. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-launches-largest-immigration-operation-ever-minneapolis-acting-director-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE LAUNCHES ‘LARGEST IMMIGRATION OPERATION EVER’ IN MINNEAPOLIS, ACTING DIRECTOR SAYS</strong></a></p><p>"Get the f--- out of Minneapolis," Frey said during a news conference. "We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite. People are being hurt, families are being ripped apart."</p><p>Frey also called the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DHS statement</a> that the shooting happened in self-defense "garbage." He claimed ICE was "creating the kind of dysfunction and chaos that they claimed to be trying to help with."</p><p>DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that Wednesday's incident was a "direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats."</p><p>Around 2,000 federal agents were deployed to Minneapolis as part of the Trump administration's continuing crackdown on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal immigration</a>. Frey, as well as other Democratic Minnesota officials, have called for federal authorities to leave the state. </p><p>The agents have been met with protesters and people filming them as they conduct operations to arrest criminal illegal immigrants. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-fraud-cases-explained-how-hundreds-millions-allegedly-slipped-through-state-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MINNESOTA FRAUD CASES, EXPLAINED: HOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ALLEGEDLY SLIPPED THROUGH STATE PROGRAMS</u></strong></a></p><p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said officials predicted violence of some kind amid the surge of federal agents in the city. He further urged people to obey the law to ensure their safety and that of authorities.  </p><p>"In addition to this tragedy, which, unfortunately, we did predict, we were seriously concerned about further escalation from the scene," he said. "I just echo the mayor's comments that we ask that people are going to be upset about what happened. And people are going to want to exercise their First Amendment rights, but please do so safely and lawfully to ensure that we do not have any further tragedy in the city or destruction."</p><p>Frey questioned the DHS narrative that agents acted in self-defense. </p><p>"What I can tell you is the narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative," he said. "That is not true. It has no truth. And it needs to be stated very clearly since we have already seen a video of it."</p><p>O'Hara said it didn't appear that the woman who was shot and killed was the target of a law enforcement operation. </p><p>"This woman was in her car, and it appeared, then blocking the street," he said. "Because of the presence of federal law enforcement, which is obviously something that has been happening, not just in Minneapolis, but around the country."</p><p>"I am obviously very concerned that I have been told that a woman who was sitting in her car blocking the street and not the target of any enforcement activity, is now deceased," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the chief</a> added.<i> "</i>I do not know the exact circumstances of the shooting, but I would tell you, in any professional law enforcement agency in the country, I think they would tell you it's obviously very concerning whenever there's a shooting into a vehicle, of someone who's not armed. But it is also something that is possible, and at times it is justified."</p>
