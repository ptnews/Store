<p>Escalating claims by Russia that Ukraine tried to hit a residence used by President Vladimir Putin with drones have been dismissed by a top military drone expert, who called the alleged attack "hard to fathom" and tactically implausible.</p><p>Cameron Chell's comments came as Moscow doubled down on accusations Kyiv has flatly denied, with the drone industry leader arguing the alleged strike announced Monday runs counter to Ukraine’s drone tactics.</p><p>Chell, the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.draganfly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draganfly</a>, a drone manufacturer that supplies to the U.S. Department of Defense and allied militaries, including Ukraine, said Russia's claims lack credibility.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-says-ukraine-peace-talks-proceeding-constructively-kremlin-launches-deadly-strike-odesa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUSSIA SAYS UKRAINE PEACE TALKS 'PROCEEDING CONSTRUCTIVELY,' AS KREMLIN LAUNCHES DEADLY STRIKE ON ODESA</strong></a></p><p>"What really makes things usually very signature about Ukraine is that they are always incredibly clever about how they <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/drones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use drones</a>," Chell told Fox News Digital.</p><p>"They are clever from a cost perspective — let’s call it an efficiency perspective — but also very clever in their tactics," he added.</p><p>"I find it hard to fathom that this drone attack even happened on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Putin’s residence</a> or that it was something that Ukraine orchestrated for a number of reasons," Chell said.</p><p>"Based on the description of the alleged attack over the top of Putin’s residence, the drones would not have been launched from a very long distance away," he said.</p><p>"This would have avoided up to 1000 km of air defense systems and then likely attacking one of the most heavily fortified air defense networks surrounding Putin’s Valdai residence.</p><p>"The cost benefit analysis, not to mention the political analysis, also does not make sense," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-warns-may-reject-us-ukraine-peace-plan-fails-uphold-alaska-summit-understandings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUSSIA WARNS IT MAY REJECT US-UKRAINE PEACE PLAN IF IT FAILS TO UPHOLD ALASKA SUMMIT 'UNDERSTANDINGS'</strong></a></p><p>Chell’s comments came as Russia doubled down Tuesday on accusations that Ukraine attempted to strike a presidential palace in the Novgorod region using drones, allegedly to disrupt peace efforts.</p><p>Kyiv dismissed the allegation, with the timing also raising questions given the upbeat tone of a recent meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Florida.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed late Monday that 91 drones were intercepted en route to Putin’s residence on the shores of Lake Valdai.</p><p>His statement appeared to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/russia-putin-drone-attack-ukraine-kremlin-trump-zelenskyy-florida-rcna251472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contradict earlier Defense Ministry tallies</a>, which said 89 drones were shot down over eight regions, including 18 over Novgorod, later adding another 23.</p><p>Only after Lavrov spoke did the ministry allege that 49 drones intercepted over Bryansk, nearly 300 miles away, were also targeting Valdai.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-peace-talks-productive-ex-government-official-says-country-rethinking-uncompromising-stance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UKRAINE PEACE TALKS PRODUCTIVE AS EX-GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAYS COUNTRY RETHINKING 'UNCOMPROMISING' STANCE</strong></a></p><p>Asked about wreckage, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was "a matter for our military," while calling <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zelenskyy’s denial</a> and Western skepticism "completely insane."</p><p>Peskov said Russia’s diplomatic stance would be toughened, and Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin vowed there could be "no forgiveness" for Zelenskyy.</p><p>Chell said the story simply does not add up. "To attack Putin’s residence in the manner described would require much more sophisticated tactics than simply sending long-range, relatively slow-moving drones," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/zelenskyy-says-peace-deal-close-trump-meeting-territory-remains-sticking-point" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ZELENSKYY SAYS PEACE DEAL IS CLOSE AFTER TRUMP MEETING BUT TERRITORY REMAINS STICKING POINT</strong></a></p><p>Chell also noted that this was a night operation and therefore, it generally rules out accurate visual mapping navigation. </p><p>"Since the description of the attack also does not lend itself to the use of fiber optic communication, which requires a relatively close range launch point, these drones would likely have had to rely on GPS navigation," he explained.</p><p>"This would easily have been thwarted in this area and the Ukrainians would have known this," Chell said.</p><p>Politically, Chell argued, Ukraine has nothing to gain. "They’re bold, but right in the middle of peace talks — when they need Trump on side — it makes no sense," he said. "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/south-florida-bulls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukraine is just politically</a> too smart to have done that."</p><p>Zelenskyy on Monday also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/zelenskyy-denies-russian-claim-ukraine-attacked-putin-residence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called the claim a complete fabrication</a>, accusing Moscow of laying the groundwork for further attacks. </p><p>Lavrov warned of retaliation but said Russia would continue talks with Washington.</p><p>Trump also said he learned of the alleged attack directly from Putin and was "very angry about it." Asked whether there was evidence, Trump replied, "We’ll find out."</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to the Kremlin for comment.</p>
