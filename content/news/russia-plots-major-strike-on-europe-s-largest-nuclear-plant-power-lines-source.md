This temporary ceasefire, the fourth we have negotiated, demonstrates the indispensable role that we continue to play."</p><p>"A deterioration of Ukraine’s power grid from persistent military activity has direct implications on the nuclear safety of its nuclear facilities," Grossi said.</p><p>"Russia is said to be going to do this strike, maybe even tonight," the source said of the ZNPP operation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-fires-new-ballistic-missile-ukraine-killing-least-four" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUSSIA FIRES NEW BALLISTIC MISSILE AT UKRAINE, KILLING AT LEAST FOUR</strong></a></p><p>"Information also from the Ukrainian Parliament and Ukrainian Security Service, or internally, is that the Russian army told the Ukrainian army that if they don't stop shelling their tankers in the sea or shelling their oil refineries, as well as their electric stations like power stations," the source said, "then they will fully destroy <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyiv energy facilities aswell</a>."</p><p>"The parliament knows this.
