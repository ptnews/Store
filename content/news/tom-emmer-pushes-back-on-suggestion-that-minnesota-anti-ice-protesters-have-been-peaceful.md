<p>Protests have gripped Minneapolis for days after a federal agent fatally shot a woman accused of trying to weaponize her car against the DHS official. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic leaders</a> are making the situation worse by fanning public anger instead of calling for peace.</p><p>"You don’t have to go very far to look and see who is fomenting all of this violence," Emmer said on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/fox-friends-weekend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox &amp; Friends Weekend"</a> Saturday.</p><p>"They’re yelling, ‘Save a life, kill ICE.’ That's not peaceful," he added, pushing back on claims from Democratic leaders that the demonstrations have been peaceful.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/masked-agitator-tells-laura-ingraham-shes-getting-paid-right-now-during-anti-ice-protest"><strong>MASKED AGITATOR TELLS LAURA INGRAHAM SHE’S 'GETTING PAID RIGHT NOW' AT ANTI-ICE PROTEST</strong></a></p><p>Protests began after 37-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/renee-good-wife-claimed-minneapolis-shooting-my-fault-video-amid-anti-ice-fury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renee Nicole Good</a> was fatally shot by an ICE officer on Wednesday. In response to the nightly demonstrations, an additional 1,000 Border Patrol agents have been sent to Minneapolis.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/picking-right-fight-congressional-tensions-rise-wake-minnesota-ice-involved-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PICKING THE RIGHT FIGHT: CONGRESSIONAL TENSIONS RISE IN WAKE OF MINNESOTA ICE-INVOLVED SHOOTING</strong></a></p><p>Multiple <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/vance-doubles-down-disgusting-press-new-footage-from-ice-shooting-surfaces-accuses-outlets-lying" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos of the incident</a> have been shared online, fueling debate over whether the agent’s use of force was justified or necessary. The Department of Homeland Security said Good was attempting to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-alleges-woman-killed-ice-shooting-stalking-impeding-agents-all-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"weaponize her vehicle"</a> to hit law enforcement agents.</p><p>Minnesota officials have disputed that account, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-fbi-can-exclude-state-authorities-from-minnesota-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling for an investigation</a> into the death. Emmer accused his colleagues of inflaming tensions, saying they rushed to anger without waiting for the investigation.</p><p>"Tim Walz should have come out right away and said, ‘Everybody be calm, withhold your judgment. We know that this is a very sensitive matter. Let law enforcement do their work,’" Emmer said, arguing state leaders failed to calm the public.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/minneapolis-police-nowhere-found-agitators-seize-control-street-after-ice-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNEAPOLIS POLICE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AS AGITATORS SEIZE CONTROL OF STREET AFTER ICE SHOOTING</strong></a></p><p>On Friday night, protesters gathered outside a hotel where they believed ICE agents were staying. Authorities said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/minneapolis-ice-shooting-1-10-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple people were arrested</a> for "unlawful assembly" after demonstrations were deemed "no longer peaceful" and resulted in property damage.</p><p>Walz said the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/gov-walz-authorizes-national-guard-staging-following-fatal-ice-shooting-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Guard</a> is prepared to deploy if necessary, but added Thursday that "we have every reason to believe that peace will hold."</p>
