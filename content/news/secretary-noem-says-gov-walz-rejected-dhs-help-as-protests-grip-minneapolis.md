Tim Walz has my phone number. I have called him and talked to him and said, ‘Listen, you let your city burn down in 2020. Don’t do it again,’" Noem said Thursday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/americas-newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America’s Newsroom</a>."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/protesters-clash-federal-officers-after-another-ice-shooting-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AGITATORS CLASH WITH FEDERAL OFFICERS AFTER ANOTHER ICE SHOOTING IN MINNEAPOLIS</strong></a></p><p>"You see a lot of news reports out there that it was another <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE shooting</a>. They didn’t report anything about the weapons or the fact that these individuals came out of a home to beat him mercilessly with a shovel and that he had to protect his own life," Noem added of the non-fatal shooting.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kristi-noem-faces-impeachment-effort-house-70-dems-push-obstruction-congress-charge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KRISTI NOEM FACES IMPEACHMENT EFFORT IN HOUSE AS 70 DEMS PUSH OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS CHARGE</strong></a></p><p>Noem blamed rhetoric from Democratic leaders, including Walz, for escalating the violence.

We are <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/federal-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enforcing federal law</a>. If you don’t like the laws, go change them, but don’t do it by giving place to these protesters and rioters that are perpetuating violence,’" Noem said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/minneapolis-mayor-frey-refuses-walk-back-get-f-out-message-ice.print" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR FREY REFUSES TO WALK BACK ‘GET THE F--- OUT’ MESSAGE TO ICE</strong></a></p><p>"I said, ‘You have my personal cell phone.
