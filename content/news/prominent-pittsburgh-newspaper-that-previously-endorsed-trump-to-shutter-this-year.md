We wish that we could be more enthusiastic and we hope the president can become more dignified and statesmanlike. Each American must make up his or her own mind and do what he or she thinks is best for the community and the republic. Vote your conscience. And, whatever happens, believe in the country."</p><p>The Post-Gazette, like several other prominent newspapers, refrained from making a presidential endorsement during the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2024/general-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 election cycle</a>.</p><p>There has been declining revenue in local journalism, particularly print newspapers, across the country in recent years as consumers increasingly get their news from digital media. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS</strong></a></p>
