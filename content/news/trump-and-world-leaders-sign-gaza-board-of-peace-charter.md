And we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations," Trump said in a statement.</p><p>"This isn’t the United States, this is for the world," he added. "I think we can spread it out to other things as we succeed in Gaza."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bernie-sanders-implies-cbs-part-oligarchy-controlling-us-while-networks-late-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>BERNIE SANDERS IMPLIES CBS IS PART OF ‘OLIGARCHY’ CONTROLLING US WHILE ON NETWORK'S ‘LATE SHOW’</u></strong></a></p><p>Trump noted that most of the 59 leaders signed onto the deal are "very popular," but others were "not so popular."</p><p>"That's the way it goes," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cancer-stricken-children-urge-bernie-sanders-back-life-saving-pediatric-healthcare-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CANCER-STRICKEN CHILDREN URGE BERNIE SANDERS TO BACK LIFE-SAVING PEDIATRIC HEALTHCARE BILL</u></strong></a></p><p>Notably absent from the board was Russian President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vladimir Putin,</a> who has said Moscow is discussing membership with Russia's "strategic partners."</p><p>The U.K. also has yet to join the board because the legal treaty "brings up much broader issues," the country's foreign secretary said.</p><p>"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we have still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine," U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-locks-nation-darker-digital-blackout-viewing-internet-existential-threat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>IRAN LOCKS NATION INTO ‘DARKER’ DIGITAL BLACKOUT, VIEWING INTERNET AS AN ‘EXISTENTIAL THREAT’</u></strong></a></p><p>Norway and Sweden have indicated that they also won’t participate after France also declined membership.
