<p>Republicans are demanding accountability over the Minnesota fraud scandal, accusing state Democrats of failing to prevent billions of dollars in taxpayer funds from being stolen. A Florida lawmaker is now calling for aggressive federal action, comparing the alleged fraud to "organized crime."</p><p>"This is what the mafia does. They steal, they lie, they cheat," Rep. Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., said on "Fox News Live" Thursday.</p><p>"The federal government has to use the full powers that we used to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/organized-crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">destroy the mafia</a> back in the 1960s. Nothing short of it," he added.</p><p>Federal authorities have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/feds-launch-massive-operation-minnesota-fraud-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched an operation in Minnesota</a> to "identify, arrest, and remove criminals who are defrauding the American people," according to the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/somali-daycare-minnesota-broken-key-documents-stolen-overnight-burglary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SOMALI DAYCARE IN MINNESOTA BROKEN INTO, KEY DOCUMENTS STOLEN IN OVERNIGHT BURGLARY</strong></a></p><p>Prosecutors accuse Minnesota of widespread fraud involving child care and other social services, saying losses could reach into the billions.</p><p>The Trump administration says it plans to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hhs-cuts-off-minnesota-child-care-payments-over-alleged-daycare-fraud-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freeze certain federal child care funds</a> until states provide additional verification for the programs. In a post on X, Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> accused Trump of playing politics in response to the proposed funding freeze.</p><p> "We’ve spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It’s a serious issue — but this has been his plan all along. He’s politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans," Walz wrote on Tuesday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ice-probes-suspected-minnesota-fraud-sites-officials-follow-potential-9b-money-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE PROBES SUSPECTED MINNESOTA FRAUD SITES AS OFFICIALS FOLLOW POTENTIAL $9B MONEY TRAIL</strong></a></p><p>Haridopolos accused <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota leaders</a> and state authorities of failing to take the allegations seriously, saying the fraud "undercuts the fabric of America."</p><p>Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz echoed those claims, demanding Minnesota officials <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testify before Congress</a> on how the alleged fraud went undetected.</p><p>"They need to explain this to the American people and the people of Minnesota," Chaffetz said on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Fox &amp; Friends"</a> Thursday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/questions-remain-licensing-site-crashes-whiplash-ensues-mn-child-care-fraud-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>QUESTIONS REMAIN, LICENSING SITE CRASHES AS WHIPLASH ENSUES IN MN CHILDCARE FRAUD SCANDAL</strong></a></p><p>Chaffetz said he believes more cases of fraud could come to light as scrutiny intensifies nationwide.</p><p>"I don’t think this is just Minnesota. I think this is going to New York, Illinois, California, your usual suspects are [going to] be right there on the list," Chaffetz said.</p><p>President Donald Trump himself suggested the estimated fraud in Minnesota could be even larger than investigators believe, speaking to a crowd at a New Year’s Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>"Can you imagine, they stole $18 billion," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-targets-minnesota-fraud-allegations-says-were-going-get-bottom-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump said.</a></p><p>"That's just what we're learning about.
