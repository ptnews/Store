<p>An <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis/australian-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open</a> match quickly turned personal for Yulia Putintseva.</p><p>The Kazakh went against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeynep Sonmez</a> of Turkey, who apparently had the home crowd by her side.</p><p>Much of the crowd was filled with Turkish flags for the match, but the fans went home disappointed after Putintseva earned a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>Upon jeers from the crowd following the win, Putintseva cupped her hand to her ear to mock the fans, resulting in loud boos.</p><p>After shaking hands with Sonmez, she then danced provocatively near her bench.</p><p>"Honestly, it was a really crazy atmosphere here. Look at them (Turkish fans). They’re very passionate about what they’re doing. It’s very great to see, especially against me, because I love this kind of battle."</p><p>While her comments on the fans were in good spirits, she took a shot at the fans off the court after claiming they had been disrespectful.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ex-american-tennis-stars-rip-reporter-over-question-amanda-anisimova" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EX-AMERICAN TENNIS STARS RIP REPORTER OVER QUESTION TO AMANDA ANISIMOVA</strong></a></p><p>"What can I do?

"But I’m very happy that I kept my calm, because Yulia last year would probably throw something at them."</p><p>Putintseva's best world ranking is 20th, which she earned last year. This is the furthest she has advanced at the Australian Open. She has also reached the quarterfinals of both the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/tennis/french-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Open</a> and the U.S. Open. She has three WTA titles to her name.</p><p>Putintseva will take on American Iva Jovic on Saturday.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
