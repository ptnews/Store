I don't know if they've changed the formula or whatever… but anyway, I went on this telehealth meeting with MidiHealth, and it was cheap. I wanted to try it myself, cause I wanted to recommend it to my friends who are like nurses and teachers."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

So, I tried Ozempic almost three years ago and I was like bedridden, I was vomiting, and then you have no energy but other people take it, and they're all good," she explained.</p><p>"I lost 30 pounds so quick," said Schumer, who is mom to 4-year-old son Gene, whom she shares with husband, Chris Fischer. "I looked great, and I couldn't lift my head off the pillow, so what's the point?"</p><p>Ozempic, which is a semaglutide injection, was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, but the medication has increasingly been prescribed off label for weight loss, along with several other similar medications. </p>
