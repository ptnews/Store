<p>President Donald Trump's Senate allies could try to kill the war powers resolution before the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate</a> wades into the debate, Fox News has learned.</p><p>Fox News is told there is an effort to kill the bipartisan effort to debate the resolution blocking military action in Venezuela.</p><p>A bipartisan coalition of senators voted to launch this debate next week.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-join-democrats-stop-trump-from-policing-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOP SENATORS JOIN DEMOCRATS TO STOP TRUMP FROM POLICING VENEZUELA</strong></a></p><p>However, Fox is told that some <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans</a> are looking for an exit ramp – even though they voted yes last week to begin the debate.</p><p>It’s possible that some Republicans may try to force a vote to table or kill the war powers resolution – because it’s not applicable. The argument is that the U.S. has no troops in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuela</a>. Therefore, this resolution is out of bounds.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-eyes-venezuelas-untapped-oil-wealth-democrats-sound-alarm-over-taxpayer-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOP EYES VENEZUELA'S UNTAPPED OIL WEALTH AS DEMOCRATS SOUND ALARM OVER TAXPAYER RISK</strong></a></p><p>It is also possible that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jd-vance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vice President JD Vance</a> could be brought in to break a tie, Fox News was told. Keep in mind that a tie means the resolution fails. But if the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration</a> wants the prospective motion to table to pass – and kill the bill – Vance could be brought in to break a tie and pass the motion to kill it.</p><p>Fox is told that the Senate has successfully "discharged" the war powers resolution onto the floor. But there is still a vote to actually get into the resolution.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-rip-senate-war-powers-push-political-theater-after-trumps-venezuela-raid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOUSE REPUBLICANS RIP SENATE WAR POWERS PUSH AS "POLITICAL THEATER" AFTER TRUMP’S VENEZUELA RAID</strong></a></p><p>It is only at that point that the Senate could vote to table the resolution.</p><p>Otherwise, the Senate must burn all 10 hours on the resolution and then vote to table. Or, vote to table after all the time is yielded back.</p>
