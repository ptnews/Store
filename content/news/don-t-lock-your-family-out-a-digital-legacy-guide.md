<p>This is not a happy topic. But it’s essential advice whether you’re 30 or 90.</p><p>If something happened to you tomorrow, could your family get into your digital life? I’m talking about your <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bank accounts</a>, emails, crypto and a lifetime of memories stored on your phone or computer.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Tech</a> and other companies won’t hand over your data or passwords, even to a spouse, without a hassle, if at all.</p><p>Start with a Legacy Contact. Think of someone you trust who gets access only after you’re gone. Who is that? Good.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/secret-phrases-get-past-ai-bot-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SECRET PHRASES TO GET YOU PAST AI BOT CUSTOMER SERVICE</strong></a></p><p><strong>· iPhone</strong>: Open <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; tap <strong>[Your Name]</strong>. Tap <strong>Sign-In &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Legacy Contact</strong>. Go to <strong>Add Legacy Contact</strong> and follow the prompts.</p><p><strong>· Google</strong>: Search for <strong>Inactive Account Manager</strong> in your Google Account settings. Choose how long <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google should wait</a> before acting (e.g., three months). Add up to 10 people to be notified and choose which data (Photos, Drive, Gmail) they can download.</p><p>Apple and Google don’t help with banking, insurance, investment or other sites or apps. You need a solid password manager like NordPass that offers emergency access features.</p><p>1. <strong>Open your Password Manager</strong> and look for <strong>Emergency Access</strong>.</p><p>2. <strong>Add a Digital Heir:</strong> Enter the email of a spouse or trusted child.</p><p>3. <strong>Set the Safety Delay: </strong>Choose a wait period. Usually <strong>7 days</strong> is the sweet spot.</p><p>4. <strong>How it works:</strong> If your contact ever requests access, the app sends you an alert. If you’re fine, you hit <strong>Deny</strong>. But if you’re incapacitated and can’t respond within those seven days, the vault automatically unlocks for them.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Your Emergency Contact only gets viewing privileges. They can’t delete or change anything in your vault.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/youll-never-trust-video-again-once-you-see-what-sora-2-can-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>YOU’LL NEVER TRUST VIDEO AGAIN ONCE YOU SEE WHAT SORA 2 CAN DO</strong></a></p><p><strong>· Crypto: </strong>Without your seed phrases, that money is gone. Store them physically along with any instructions and receipts of you buying crypto with your estate paperwork. If you use a crypto hardware wallet, keep that in a fireproof safe.</p><p><strong>· Social media:</strong> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Facebook</a> or Instagram, go to Settings &gt; Memorialization. Choose to either have your account deleted or managed by a contact who can post a final tribute.</p><p>Be sure someone knows the passcode to your phone. That’s important for 2FA codes, among other things.</p><p><strong>One more thing. </strong>If you found this guide helpful, be sure to get my free newsletter at GetKim.com to stay tech-savvy and secure every day!</p><p><strong>Award-winning host Kim Komando is your secret weapon for navigating tech.</strong></p><p><strong>· National radio:</strong> Airing on 500-plus stations across the US, find yours at komando.com or get the free podcast</p><p><strong>· Daily newsletter:</strong> Join 650,000 people who read the Current (free!) at komando.com</p><p><strong>· Watch: </strong>Kim's YouTube channel at youtube.com/@kimkomando</p><p>Copyright 2026, WestStar Multimedia Entertainment.
