<p>Hillary and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bill-clinton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Clinton</a> are both now risking possible criminal charges after defying subpoenas to appear before the House Oversight Committee.</p><p>Hillary Clinton was compelled to sit for a sworn deposition behind closed doors on Wednesday morning as part of the House's bipartisan probe into Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>However, the former secretary of state refused to appear, and the House Oversight Committee will begin contempt of Congress proceedings, a source familiar told Fox News Digital.</p><p>She was expected to skip the meeting after her and former President Bill Clinton's attorneys wrote to House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., arguing the subpoenas were not legally enforceable.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-gop-chair-issues-stark-warning-clintons-defy-depositions-epstein-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TOP GOP CHAIR ISSUES STARK WARNING TO CLINTONS IF THEY DEFY DEPOSITIONS IN EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION</strong></a></p><p>A committee aide said earlier that the committee would initiate contempt of Congress proceedings "in the coming days" if she did not appear. Comer is already moving forward with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-clinton-scheduled-appear-before-oversight-committee-contempt-congress-threat-looms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contempt proceedings against Bill</a> Clinton.</p><p>The lawyers' letter argued Comer's subpoenas were "invalid and legally unenforceable, untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers."</p><p>It also compared Comer's leadership of the probe to Joseph McCarthy's 1950s-era abuse of congressional power, while pointing out that President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> has publicly called for the federal government to look into Bill Clinton's Epstein ties.</p><p>"Mindful of these defects, we trust you will engage in good faith to de-escalate this dispute," the letter said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-oversight-committee-subpoena-les-wexner-2-others-epstein-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO SUBPOENA LES WEXNER, 2 OTHERS IN EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION</strong></a></p><p>Comer told reporters Tuesday that he read the letter but suggested <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his probe</a> would be undeterred.</p><p>The former president similarly skipped his own scheduled deposition on Tuesday, prompting Comer to say his panel would move ahead with advancing a contempt of Congress resolution against him next week.</p><p>Such resolutions need to advance through the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relevant committees</a> before being considered in a House-wide vote.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-expected-defy-epstein-probe-subpoena-risking-criminal-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HILLARY CLINTON EXPECTED TO DEFY EPSTEIN PROBE SUBPOENA, RISKING CRIMINAL CHARGES</strong></a></p><p>It's then up to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> on whether to pursue the resulting criminal referral if a majority of House lawmakers vote to make it.</p><p>Contempt of Congress charges are a misdemeanor that carry up to a year in jail and a maximum fine of $100,000.</p><p>Former Trump advisors Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro were notably charged and convicted of contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas by the now-defunct select committee on the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.</p><p>The former first couple were two of 10 people subpoenaed by Comer as part of the panel's investigation into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeffrey-epstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Jeffrey Epstein</u></a>. The subpoenas were issued following a bipartisan vote by an Oversight subcommittee panel during an unrelated hearing on illegal immigration.</p>
