<p>In the immediate aftermath of conservative titan Charlie Kirk's assassination, academics across the nation found themselves in hot water over a litany of crude commentary celebrating the Turning Point USA founder's death.</p><p>But after short disciplinary stints, many have been reinstated as the spring semester begins.</p><p>On Dec. 30, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/tennessee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Austin Peay State University in Tennessee</a> sent a message to community members notifying them that Darren Michael, an associate professor of acting and directing, had been reinstated. Michael was fired on Sept. 12, two days after Kirk's assassination. He shared a post with a 2023 remark by Kirk that gun deaths were "unfortunately worth it" to protect the Second Amendment.</p><p>On top of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/campus-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being rehired</a>, Austin Peay acknowledged that it had not followed its own policies for terminating tenured faculty, and paid Michael a $500,000 settlement, according to local reports.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hamline-university-student-brags-video-that-he-celebrated-charlie-kirk-assassination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HAMLINE UNIVERSITY STUDENT BRAGS ON VIDEO THAT HE CELEBRATED CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION</strong></a></p><p>At the University of South Dakota, art professor Michael Hook was fired for slamming Kirk in the wake of his assassination.</p><p>"Okay. I don’t give a flying f--- about this Kirk person," Hook said hours after Kirk was killed, according to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/26/court-order-reinstates-sd-prof-fired-kirk-comments?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inside Hire Ed.</a> "I’m sorry for his family that he was a hate spreading Nazi and got killed. I’m sure they deserved better. Maybe good people could now enter their lives. But geez, where was all this concern when the politicians in Minnesota were shot? And the school shootings? And Capitol Police? I have no thoughts or prayers for this hate spreading Nazi. A shrug, maybe."</p><p>Hook sued the school after his termination, and on Sept. 26, a federal judge ordered him to be temporarily reinstated while the legal proceedings continued, deciding that he had a reasonable chance of prevailing in his suit.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tips"><strong>GOT A SCOOP ON CAMPUS? SEND US A TIP HERE</strong></a></p><p>Shortly thereafter, the South Dakota Board of Regents agreed not to fire Hook, and he dropped his lawsuit, <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/education/2025/10/06/usd-sdbor-university-of-south-dakota-board-of-regents-professor-dismiss-lawsuit/86550989007/?gnt-cfr=1&amp;gca-cat=p&amp;gca-uir=false&amp;gca-epti=z11xx54p115650c115650d00----v11xx54&amp;gca-ft=255&amp;gca-ds=sophi" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Argus Leader reported</a>.</p><p>A trio of faculty members at Florida Atlantic University were placed on administrative leave for social media posts related to Kirk's death.</p><p>Tenured finance professor Rebel Cole responded to comments about Kirk's death, saying, "We are going to hunt you down," and "we are going to identify you," which prompted some students to feel uncomfortable, <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/boca-raton/second-fau-professor-placed-on-leave-after-controversial-political-posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to WPTV</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kansas-professor-put-leave-after-calling-white-men-dangerous-animals-wake-charlie-kirk-murder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>KANSAS PROFESSOR PUT ON LEAVE AFTER CALLING WHITE MEN 'DANGEROUS ANIMALS' IN THE WAKE OF CHARLIE KIRK'S MURDER</strong></a></p><p>Another tenured professor, Karen Leader, was placed on leave after reposts calling Kirk "racist," "transphobic" and homophobic, according to the <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/boca-raton/employment-experts-weigh-in-on-fau-professor-placed-on-leave-after-charlie-kirk-post" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">same outlet</a>.</p><p>Both were reinstated for the spring term.</p><p>The third FAU professor, Kate Polak, is not tenured and remains on leave during the spring semester, the South Florida Sun Sentinel <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2026/01/09/fau-professor-suspended-over-charlie-kirk-comments-will-not-be-reinstated-ahead-of-spring-semester/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> on Jan. 9.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/erika-kirk-delivers-powerful-rebuke-those-celebrating-her-husbands-assassination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ERIKA KIRK DELIVERS POWERFUL REBUKE TO THOSE CELEBRATING HER HUSBAND'S ASSASSINATION</strong></a></p><p>She wrote on social media that "delighting in the death of someone who wished death on us isn’t sick," and rather described it as "self-defense."

He was fired on Sept. 26 after reposting a comment on Facebook.</p><p>"I’ll never advocate for violence in any form, but it sounds to me like karma is sometimes swift and ironic," the post said. "As Kirk said, 'Play certain games, win certain prizes.'"</p><p>The post also said that "no one should be gunned down" but that Kirk was a "flawed human being whose rhetoric caused notable damage."</p><p>Bregy sued the school, and Clemson agreed to rescind his termination.
