<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> said Sunday that Iran is "starting to" cross U.S. red lines, citing reports of civilian deaths and warning that any attack on American interests would be met with overwhelming force as his administration weighs what he called "very strong options."</p><p>Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Palm Beach, Florida, back to Washington, D.C., after being asked whether Iran had crossed a threshold that would trigger a response.</p><p>"They're starting to, it looks like, and there seem to be some people killed that aren't supposed to be killed," the president said. "These are violent — if you call them leaders, I don't know if their leaders or just if they rule through violence. And, we're looking at some very strong options. We’ll make a determination."</p><p>Some <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protesters were killed</a> in a stampede while others were shot, Trump later said, adding that he receives hourly briefings and will decide based on ongoing reports.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/exiled-iranian-crown-prince-urges-trump-help-protests-against-islamic-regime-intensify-man-of-peace" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EXILED IRANIAN CROWN PRINCE URGES TRUMP TO HELP AS PROTESTS AGAINST ISLAMIC REGIME INTENSIFY: 'MAN OF PEACE'</strong></a></p><p>The comments came just days after Trump warned the U.S. would respond forcefully if the Iranian regime escalates its crackdown.</p><p>"Iran’s in big trouble," he said. "It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago. We’re watching the situation very carefully."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/iran-regime-very-close-collapsing-protests-rage-opposition-leader-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EXILED IRANIAN PRINCE SAYS REGIME ‘VERY CLOSE TO COLLAPSING' AMID NATIONWIDE UNREST</strong></a></p><p>Trump added, "We’ll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn’t mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts."</p><p>Protests had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-flips-kill-switch-hide-alleged-crimes-death-toll-rises-amid-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spread to at least 190 cities</a> across Iran by Saturday, according to the National Council of Resistance in Iran.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/armed-iran-protesters-battle-police-tehran-streets-trump-warns-forceful-us-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ARMED IRANIAN PROTESTERS BATTLE POLICE IN TEHRAN STREETS AS TRUMP WARNS OF FORCEFUL US RESPONSE</strong></a></p><p>The Associated Press reported Sunday that activists claimed at least 544 people have been killed, with more feared dead.
