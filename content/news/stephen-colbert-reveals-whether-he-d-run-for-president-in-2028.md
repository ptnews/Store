Why, who am I to say that I should run? But if I hear the call obviously of the Lord..." Colbert said, before the crowd began chanting his name.</p><p>His fellow panelists, former CBS News anchor John Dickerson and New York Times staff writer Emily Bazelon, agreed with his original comment, with Bazelon calling the idea "miserable."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/stephen-colbert-sarcastically-salutes-paramounts-new-chief-national-bosss-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>STEPHEN COLBERT SARCASTICALLY SALUTES PARAMOUNT’S NEW CHIEF ON 'NATIONAL BOSS’S DAY'</strong></a></p><p>Colbert previously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/02/us/politics/02colbert.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ran for president</a> as a Democrat in 2007 under the guise of his "Colbert Report" caricature. Although he paid the $2,500 fee to be included in the South Carolina Democratic primary ballot, the South Carolina Democratic Primary executive council refused his application, believing that he was not a serious candidate.</p><p>Colbert also floated the idea of running again on his show <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/stephen-colbert-runs-president-talks-george-stephanopoulos/story?id=15363182" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in 2012</a> and launched a committee to run for president in South Carolina.
