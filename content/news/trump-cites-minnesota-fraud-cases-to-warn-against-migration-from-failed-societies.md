<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> took a shot at Somalia and claimed that the investigations Minnesota faces into alleged fraud schemes are a reminder that the West cannot allow mass migration from "failed" societies. </p><p>Minnesota has encountered heightened scrutiny in recent months as the state faces investigations into multiple alleged fraud schemes plaguing the state’s social services system. </p><p>The majority of those charged are part of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/somali-immigrant-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota’s Somali population</a>, and Trump unveiled plans in November 2025 to end the temporary protected status for Somali migrants in Minnesota that offers protections against deportation.</p><p>"The situation in Minnesota reminds us that the West cannot mass import foreign cultures, which have failed to ever build a successful society of their own," Trump said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "I mean, we're taking people from Somalia, and Somalia is a failed — it's not a nation — got no government, got no police … got no nothing."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nato-chief-praises-trump-davos-says-he-forced-europe-step-up-defense" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NATO CHIEF PRAISES TRUMP AT DAVOS, SAYS HE FORCED EUROPE TO ‘STEP UP’ ON DEFENSE</strong></a></p><p>Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent announced in December 2025 that his agency was launching an investigation evaluating whether Minnesota’s funds were potentially diverted to al-Shabab, a terrorist organization based in Somalia. </p><p>Lawmakers also initiated probes into Minnesota's alleged "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/youtuber-testify-before-congress-minnesotas-massive-9b-fraud-network-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feeding Our Future</a>" $250 million fraud scheme that allegedly targeted a children's nutrition program the Department of Agriculture funded and that Minnesota oversaw during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>At least 77 people have been charged in that scheme, which took advantage of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's decision to waive certain Federal Child Nutrition Program requirements.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rips-crooked-ilhan-omar-house-ramps-investigation-exploding-net-worth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP RIPS 'CROOKED' ILHAN OMAR AS HOUSE RAMPS UP INVESTIGATION INTO EXPLODING NET WORTH</strong></a></p><p>Likewise, another alleged fraud scheme in the state stems from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Housing Stability Services Program</a>, which allegedly offered Medicaid coverage for housing stabilization services in an attempt to help those with disabilities, mental illnesses and substance-use disorders receive housing.</p><p>The Justice Department so far has charged less than a dozen people for allegedly defrauding the program that runs through Minnesota’s Medicaid service, but more charges are expected.</p><p>Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a>, a Democrat, has claimed that he believes that reports indicating the fraud could total over $9 billion are exaggerated and "sensationalized," but he's also promised to address the issue. </p><p>"I am accountable for this, and more importantly, I am the one that will fix it," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/governors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walz told reporters</a> in December 2025.</p>
