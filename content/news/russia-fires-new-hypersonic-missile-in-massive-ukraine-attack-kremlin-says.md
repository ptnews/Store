<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/zelenskyy-denies-russian-claim-ukraine-attacked-putin-residence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russia said</a> on Friday it used its new hypersonic Oreshnik missile in an attack against Ukraine, according to reports.</p><p>The Kremlin said that the strike was carried out in response to what it said was an attempted Ukrainian drone strike on one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's residences, something Kyiv has denied, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russia-says-it-fired-its-oreshnik-missile-ukraine-response-strike-putins-2026-01-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Reuters</a>. </p><p>The outlet noted that Ukraine and the U.S. have cast doubt on Russia’s claims about the alleged attempted attack on Putin’s residence on Dec. 29, the report said. Ukraine called it "an absurd lie," while President Donald Trump also doubted the veracity of the claim, saying he did not believe the strike occurred and that "something" unrelated happened nearby.</p><p>This is the second time Russia has used the intermediate-range Oreshnik, which Putin has said is impossible to intercept because of its velocity, Reuters reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-alleges-attack-putin-residence-ukraine-denies-claim-ahead-trump-talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RUSSIA ALLEGES ATTACK ON PUTIN RESIDENCE AS UKRAINE DENIES CLAIM AHEAD OF TRUMP TALKS</strong></a></p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry said that the strike targeted critical infrastructure in Ukraine, according to Reuters, which added that Russia said the attack also used attack drones and high-precision long-range land and sea-based weapons.</p><p>While Moscow did not say where the missile hit, Russian media and military bloggers said it targeted an underground natural gas storage facility in Ukraine's western Leviv region, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-hypersonic-missile-oreshnik-massive-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBS News reported</a>. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadoviy said the attack hit critical infrastructure but did not give details, the outlet added.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the attack on social media, saying that the aftermath was "still being dealt with."</p><p>"Twenty residential buildings alone were damaged. Recovery operations after the strikes also continue in the Lviv region and other regions of our country. Unfortunately, as of now, it is known that four people have been killed in the capital alone. Among them is an ambulance crew member. My condolences to their families and loved ones," Zelenskyy wrote.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/putin-residence-attack-video-slammed-us-officials-say-ukraine-target-leader" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PUTIN RESIDENCE ATTACK VIDEO SLAMMED AS US OFFICIALS SAY UKRAINE DID NOT TARGET LEADER</strong></a></p><p>The Ukrainian leader said the attack involved 242 drones, 13 ballistic missiles, one Oreshnik missile and 22 cruise missiles. Zelenskyy added that the ballistic missiles were aimed at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-winter-strike-leaves-nearly-800k-homes-without-power-heat-ukraines-dnipro-region" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy facilities and civilian infrastructure</a> as the people of Ukraine faced "a significant cold spell." He said the attack was "aimed precisely against the normal life of ordinary people." However, he assured that Ukraine was working to restore heating and electricity.</p><p>Zelenskyy claimed that in addition to the civilian infrastructure, a building of the Embassy of Qatar was damaged in the attack.</p><p>"A clear reaction from the world is needed. Above all from the United States, whose signals Russia truly pays attention to. Russia must receive signals that it is its obligation to focus on diplomacy, and must feel consequences every time it again focuses on killings and the destruction of infrastructure," Zelenskyy added.</p><p>A spokesperson for the State Department told Fox News Digital that the U.S. remains committed to ending the war through diplomatic means, emphasizing that it is the only path toward a durable peace. The spokesperson underscored Trump's desire to end the war that is approaching its fourth year.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.</p>
