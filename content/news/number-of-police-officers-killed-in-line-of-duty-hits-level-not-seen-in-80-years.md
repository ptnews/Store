They are the tip of the spear for egregious acts," Bill Alexander, the Fund’s chief executive officer, told The Associated Press. "Even one officer fatality is too many, and our ultimate goal is to have none. But we’re heartened by any decrease in those numbers."</p><p>Traffic-related deaths fell nearly 23% year over year, according to the data.</p><p>Alexander attributed the decline in fatalities from crashes and officers getting struck by vehicles during traffic stops to the growing attention to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/attributes/safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roadside safety</a>.
