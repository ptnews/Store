<p>The Trump administration is considering paying each Greenland resident thousands of dollars as part of a bid to encourage the territory to secede from Denmark and join the United States, according to Reuters. </p><p>U.S. officials, including White House aides, have discussed payment figures ranging from $10,000 to $100,000, the outlet reported, citing sources. </p><p>For an island with a population of roughly 57,000, the total cost could range from more than half a billion dollars to nearly $6 billion.</p><p>While discussions of a lump-sum payment are not new, Reuters reported that officials have become more serious in recent days and are considering higher amounts.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/noem-announces-arctic-defense-pact-canada-finland-counter-rival-powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NOEM ANNOUNCES ARCTIC DEFENSE PACT WITH CANADA, FINLAND TO COUNTER RIVAL POWERS</strong></a></p><p>The White House referred Fox News Digital on Thursday to remarks by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said during a Wednesday briefing that buying Greenland would benefit U.S. national security.</p><p>"The acquisition of Greenland by the United States is not a new idea," Leavitt said. </p><p>"The president has been very open and clear with all of you and the world that he views it as in the best interest of the United States to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region," she said. "That's why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-taps-republican-governor-serve-special-envoy-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP TAPS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO SERVE AS SPECIAL ENVOY TO GREENLAND</strong></a></p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that he plans to meet with his Danish counterpart next week to discuss Greenland.</p><p>Trump has long contended that the U.S. should acquire Greenland, arguing that its mineral resources are vital in advancing U.S. military technologies and that the Western Hemisphere should broadly fall under Washington’s geopolitical influence.</p><p>On Sunday, Trump told reporters <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-moves-greenland-military-installation-us-northern-command-arctic-power-shift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenland is surrounded by Russian</a> and Chinese ships and that Denmark, which governs Greenland, lacks the capability to provide the level of defense and oversight that meets U.S. national security standards.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/from-caracas-nuuk-maduro-raid-sparks-fresh-trump-push-greenland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FROM CARACAS TO NUUK: MADURO RAID SPARKS FRESH TRUMP PUSH ON GREENLAND</strong></a></p><p>"It's so strategic," Trump told reporters on Air Force One. "We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it."</p><p>Authorities in Greenland and Denmark insist that Greenland is not for sale, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/european-allies-working-plan-us-acts-acquiring-greenland-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European leaders have criticized the proposal</a>, arguing that it undermines trust between the U.S. and Denmark as NATO allies. Under the NATO defense agreement, allies are obliged to support one another militarily if attacked, making the idea of a sale particularly sensitive.</p><p>"This is enough," Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday, responding to Trump’s Sunday remarks about acquiring the island. "No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation."</p><p>On Tuesday, Nielsen added that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/denmark-summons-us-envoy-over-alleged-covert-greenland-interference-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenland will remain part of Denmark</a> despite U.S. efforts.</p><p>"Our country isn't something you can deny or take over because you want to," he added. "Once again, I urge the United States to seek respectful dialogue through the correct diplomatic and political channels and utilizing pre-existing forums that are based on agreements already in place with the United States. The dialogue must take place with respect to the fact that Greenland's status is rooted in international law and the principle of territorial integrity." </p>
