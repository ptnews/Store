"I should be fine in a couple days."</p><p>Horn careened down the track but still reached high speeds during a run that lasted just over a minute. He guided the sled across the finish line, then moved to the back and pulled the brake handles himself.</p><p>Athletes and coaches from several national teams rushed to the finish line to check on Horn as the sled skidded to a stop. Horn, whose bobsled career began as a brakeman, waved to nearby television cameras to signal he was unharmed.</p><p>Horn also crashed during the two-man World Cup race Saturday. His brakeman for that event, Carsten Vissering, suffered abrasions and was unable to compete Sunday in the four-man.
