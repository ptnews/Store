<p>One of the seven House Democrats who voted with Republicans to advance a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) spending bill last week is now characterizing his vote as a mistake, highlighting growing unrest among moderate Democrats over the department's funding even as lawmakers look to escape a looming government shutdown.</p><p>In the wake of a deadly clash between immigration enforcement and agitators in Minnesota over the weekend, Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., apologized publicly for his vote <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RepTomSuozzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>in a post to Facebook.</u></a></p><p>"I failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis," Suozzi said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a key agency in President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump's</a> immigration crackdown efforts.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-relent-senate-sends-174b-spending-package-trumps-desk-shutdown-looms-over-dhs-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEMS RELENT, SENATE SENDS $174B SPENDING PACKAGE TO TRUMP'S DESK AS SHUTDOWN LOOMS OVER DHS FUNDING</strong></a></p><p>"I hear the anger from my constituents and I take responsibility for that. I have long been critical of ICE’s unlawful behavior, and I must do a better job demonstrating that," he added.</p><p>The other six Democrats contacted by Fox News Digital did not respond to inquiries about their votes.</p><p>Suozzi's comments come as Democrats in the Senate are signaling growing opposition to passing the DHS bill and funding the government ahead of a possible shutdown on Jan. 30. The DHS bill, which includes funding for ICE, is part of a four-bill package that the House of Representatives passed last week.</p><p>The political outlook of the DHS funding bill changed over the weekend with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/protesters-clash-federal-officers-after-another-ice-shooting-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the death of Alex Pretti.</a></p><p>According to DHS, ICE officers shot and killed Pretti, 37, in a confrontation on Saturday when Pretti attempted to disrupt law enforcement activities while in possession of a firearm. DHS Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristi-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Noem</a> has said agents acted in self-defense.</p><p>Pretti is the second civilian shot by ICE in the past month.</p><p>The Friday before Pretti’s death, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/7-house-democrats-break-jeffries-pass-dhs-funding-despite-ice-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suozzi and six other Democrats</a> broke with the rest of their party to advance a DHS funding bill that the majority of the party had condemned as inadequate in its provisions on ICE.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-sen-cassidy-breaks-trump-over-deadly-shooting-border-patrol-agent-minneapolis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOP SEN. CASSIDY BREAKS WITH TRUMP OVER DEADLY SHOOTING BY BORDER PATROL AGENT IN MINNEAPOLIS</strong></a></p><p>Even with new body camera requirements, additional training mandates and some reductions in funding, Democrats saw the package as unlikely to prevent future deadly clashes between ICE and agitators.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ilhan-omar-vows-not-give-ice-single-cent-heated-congressional-funding-fight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Ilhan Omar,</a> D-Minn., and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of over 70 lawmakers, said they wouldn’t support a spending bill that didn’t include greater guardrails for ICE.</p><p>"I am glad to announce that the Congressional Progressive Caucus has adopted an official position to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/government-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold ICE accountable</a>. Our caucus members will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriations bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices," Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said at a press event shortly before Republicans unveiled their DHS bill last week.</p><p>Their calls were soon adopted by party leadership in the chamber.</p><p>Now, with the death of Pretti, what little support the DHS funding had among Democrats is dwindling further. </p><p>Suozzi, who had highlighted his role as one of seven Democrats to support the bill on his website, called on Trump to end his ICE deportation campaign.</p><p>"The senseless and tragic murder of Alex Pretti underscores what happens when untrained federal agents operate without accountability. President Trump must immediately end ‘Operation Metro Surge’ and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE’s occupation of Minneapolis</a> that has sown chaos, led to tragedy and undermined experienced local law enforcement," Suozzi said.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/senate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate is expected to vote</a> on the bundle of four bills in the coming days. Questions remain whether negotiators will modify the DHS package to avoid a shutdown if Democrats remain united in their opposition.</p><p>If modified, the package would have to be taken up again in the House. U.S. House Speaker <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Johnson</a>, R-La., has said he has no intention of bringing the House back in the coming week.</p>
