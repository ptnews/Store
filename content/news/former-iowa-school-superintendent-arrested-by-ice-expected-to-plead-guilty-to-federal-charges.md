<p>The former superintendent of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/iowa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iowa's largest school district</a> is set to plead guilty Thursday to a pair of federal charges following his arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last year. </p><p>Ian Roberts, a native of Guyana in South America and once the leader of Des Moines Public Schools, was detained by federal immigration officers on Sept. 26, 2025. He <a class="Hyperlink SCXW260095021 BCX0" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/iowa-school-superintendent-resigns-ice-arrest-rocks-des-moines-district" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>resigned from his position</u></a> shortly afterward. </p><p>In October, Roberts initially pleaded not guilty to one count of making a false statement for employment and one count of unlawfully possessing a firearm while being in the U.S. illegally. Together, the charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to prosecutors.</p><p>Roberts is now expected to plead guilty to both charges, according to a plea agreement he signed Wednesday. The agreement also indicates that Roberts is aware he could face deportation after he serves his sentence.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-des-moines-schools-superintendent-taken-doj-custody-federal-firearms-immigration-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FORMER DES MOINES SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT TAKEN INTO DOJ CUSTODY ON FEDERAL FIREARMS, IMMIGRATION CHARGES</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Homeland Security</a> previously said Roberts has an extensive criminal history, including drug and weapons possession. </p><p>"Ian Andre Roberts, a criminal illegal alien with multiple weapons charges and a drug trafficking charge, should have never been able to work around children," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said around the time of his arrest last September. "When <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/school-chief-suspect-ice-arrest-des-moines-superintendent-exposes-fake-degrees-drug-convictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICE officers arrested this superintendent</a>, he was in possession of an illegal handgun, a hunting knife, and nearly $3,000 in cash." </p><p>A federal grand jury in October returned a two-count indictment. According to the plea agreement, Roberts admitted he knowingly and intentionally made a "false attestation" on the Employment Eligibility Verification form, known as an I-9, that he submitted in Des Moines, claiming he was a U.S. citizen. That carries a punishment of up to five years in prison and a fine.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-state-election-board-under-fire-after-ice-arrested-superintendent-surfaces-voter-rolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DEM STATE ELECTION BOARD UNDER FIRE AFTER ICE-ARRESTED SUPERINTENDENT SURFACES ON VOTER ROLLS</strong></a></p><p>Roberts completed the I-9 form when he was hired in 2023 and submitted a Social Security card and driver’s license as verifying documents, according to the district. He also stated he was a U.S. citizen in his application to the state board of educational examiners, which issued Roberts a professional administrator license in 2023. </p><p>Roberts was subject to a notice to appear before an immigration judge in October 2020, just months before his <a class="Hyperlink SCXW260095021 BCX0" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/school-chief-suspect-ice-arrest-des-moines-superintendent-exposes-fake-degrees-drug-convictions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>work authorization was set to expire,</u></a> and a final removal order in 2024, authorities said. District officials said they were not aware of the immigration issues, The Associated Press reported. </p><p>Alfredo Parrish, one of Roberts’ attorneys, has said his client was under the impression from a prior attorney that his immigration case was "resolved successfully." </p><p>Roberts also faces a federal weapons charge, punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine. The indictment describes two pistols, a rifle and a shotgun found in Roberts’ possession. In addition to the one in his vehicle when he was arrested, three firearms were found during a search of Roberts’ home, authorities said.</p><p>Roberts will agree to forfeit the weapons, according to the agreement. </p><p><i>Fox News Digital’s Louis Casiano and The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p>
