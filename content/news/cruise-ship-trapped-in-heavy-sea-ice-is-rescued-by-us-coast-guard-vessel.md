The following day, the natural movement of the ice had opened up again, and conditions had normalized," Scenic Group told Fox News Digital. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>The cruise line noted the moment was memorable — with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">champagne served</a> on the Observation Deck.</p><p><i>"</i>We were grateful for the professionalism and cooperation of the crew of USCG Polar Star during our operations in the Ross Sea. While Scenic Eclipse II was never in need of rescue services, the coordination between both vessels ensured we could navigate the changing pack ice safely and efficiently," said Captain James Griffiths, Scenic Group’s general manager of ocean operations.</p><p>The rescue coincided with a milestone for the Coast Guard vessel — which marked its 50th year of commissioned service on the same day it assisted the cruise ship.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"At 50 years old, Polar Star remains the world’s most capable non-nuclear icebreaker," said Commander Samuel Blase, Polar Star’s executive officer.</p><p>Based in Seattle, the Polar Star is the United States’ only active heavy icebreaker, according to the Coast Guard.</p><p>Commissioned in 1976, <a href="https://https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/boating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vessel</a> is powered by multiple high-output engines that give it the ability to break through miles of thick Antarctic ice.</p><p>The Coast Guard said Polar Star conducts annual missions to McMurdo Station in Antarctica as part of Operation Deep Freeze, breaking through miles of ice that can reach up to 21 feet thick.</p>
