The agency previously said its enforcement actions are focused on individuals in this country illegally who pose public safety or national security concerns.</p><p>Southeast Asian and Latin street food restaurants Hola Arepa &amp; Hai Hai wrote in a joint Instagram account that they will be closed "in support of the general strike to remove ICE from our cities and get justice for Renee Good."</p><p>Wildflyer Coffee shared that its two locations will be closed "to ensure our staff can participate in ways that feel meaningful to them and to further exist in solidarity with the movement," the business wrote on Instagram.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffee shop</a> wrote that it is also seeking $2,500 "to help offset lost wages and revenue."</p><p>"Your contribution helps ensure that we can take care of our staff and programming in the face of this challenging time," the post said.</p><p>Lost Fox, a St. Paul café, <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/social-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced on Instagram</a> it will close "in solidarity with ICE OUT of MN" — and encouraged others to participate in the march.</p><p>The same café is also handing out whistles, writing, "Come by and grab one this week if you don't already have one."</p><p>An <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/recipes/cuisines/italian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argentinian Italian</a> restaurant, Martina, posted on its Instagram page that it will be participating in the strike.</p><p>"Based on many meaningful conversations with team members, we have made the decision to close Martina on Friday, January 23rd.

[This] is why many lawyers encourage language like, 'We do not consent to immigration enforcement in non‑public areas without a judicial warrant.'"</p><p>"At the same time, staff have to be trained that if agents do show up with a valid warrant, this is not the moment for a heroic physical standoff," Patillo added. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</strong></a></p><p>"The law draws a bright line between saying, 'We won't help you,' and actively blocking or hiding someone named in that warrant."</p><p>Clergy members on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/jan-23-day-truth-freedom-minnesota-ice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to Fox 9</a>, plan to announce hundreds of places of worship in Minnesota that will also take part in Friday's shutdown denouncing the ICE surge. </p>
