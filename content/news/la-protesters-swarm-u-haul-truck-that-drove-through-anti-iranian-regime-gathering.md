<p>Protesters demonstrating against the Iranian regime swarmed a U-Haul truck that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/u-haul-truck-drives-through-iran-protest-crowd-los-angeles-one-person-struck-driver-detained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drove through their gathering</a> in Los Angeles on Sunday, smashing its windshield and attacking the suspected driver with flag poles until police arrived to take the man into custody.</p><p>Video footage shows the crowd of people running toward the truck and surrounding it as people can be heard chanting at the individual behind the wheel.</p><p>One member of the crowd climbed onto the truck and stomped on its windshield. Others took flagpoles bearing the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iranian flag</a> and stuck them through an open passenger-side window, appearing to jab the suspect.</p><p>A person was also seen tearing down a banner on the side of the truck that read, in all capital letters, "NO SHAH. NO REGIME. USA: DON’T REPEAT 1953. NO MULLAH."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-supreme-leader-says-protesters-ruining-own-streets-please-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER BLAMES TRUMP FOR INCREASINGLY INTENSE DEMONSTRATIONS</strong></a></p><p>As the driver tried to exit the truck through the driver-side door, the crowd could be seen pushing the door closed.
