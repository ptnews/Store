<p>The Biden administration resurrected a 1994 law against obstructing abortion clinics or religious worship to prosecute protesters, but now conservatives are seeking that the same policy be applied after leftist agitators crashed a Minneapolis church service.</p><p>The FACE Act, drafted by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a noted Catholic, and signed by former President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bill-clinton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Clinton</a>, prohibits intentionally injuring or intimidating people seeking "reproductive care" services, and also has a section protecting people "exercising … religious freedom at a place of religious worship."</p><p>Clinton also used his remarks signing the law to introduce his oft-cited view that abortion should be "safe, legal and rare."</p><p>"Enacting this bill to provide freedom of access to clinics has been a priority because protecting the freedoms of our citizens is surely chief among the responsibilities of the President of the United States," Clinton added at the time. "This bill is designed to eliminate violence and coercion. It is not a strike against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/first-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Amendment</a>; far from it."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyt-slammed-over-report-saying-protest-minnesota-church-service-adds-tensions-over-ice-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NYT SLAMMED OVER REPORT SAYING PROTEST AT MINNESOTA CHURCH SERVICE 'ADDS TO TENSIONS OVER ICE TACTICS'</strong></a></p><p>The Biden Justice Department pursued FACE Act charges against dozens of people, which was seen as an uptick over prior administrations that all utilized the law.</p><p>Alliance Defending Freedom’s Erin Hawley testified before the House Judiciary Committee during that time saying: "Instead of applying the FACE Act in an even-handed way, the Biden DOJ has weaponized the Act to target <a class="c-link c-link--underline" href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pro-life advocates</u></a>."</p><p>The most-reported case was that of Mark Houck, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fbis-attack-pro-life-catholics-bidens-america-jim-jordan-warns" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a pro-life supporter</a> from Kintnersville, Pennsylvania, who was arrested outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic following a run-in with an activist.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/st-paul-pastor-denounces-anti-ice-agitators-who-disrupted-church-service-says-were-here-worship-jesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ST PAUL PASTOR DENOUNCES ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO DISRUPTED CHURCH SERVICE, SAYS 'WE'RE HERE TO WORSHIP JESUS'</strong></a></p><p>Houck often publicly prayed and tried to counsel people outside the center, and on that day in 2021, he was reportedly confronted by Bruce Love, an escort for an abortion patient.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/commentary/fbi-justice-department-twist-federal-law-arrest-charge-pro-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">recounting by</a> the Heritage Foundation’s Cully Stimson, Love previously encountered Houck multiple times and expressed vulgar slurs to him, when Houck "defended" his 12-year-old son from one of Love’s advances and the man fell.</p><p>Stimson noted that the case was "so weak" that Philadelphia County District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, declined to file any charges against Houck.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/don-lemon-claims-some-religious-groups-have-entitlement-after-anti-ice-church-protest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DON LEMON CLAIMS SOME RELIGIOUS GROUPS HAVE 'ENTITLEMENT' FROM WHITE SUPREMACY AFTER ANTI-ICE CHURCH PROTEST</strong></a></p><p>But, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBI later raided Houck’s home</a>, frightening his children, and he faced 11 years in prison and a $350,000 fine.

Sean Casten, D-Ill., <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jerrold-nadler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerry Nadler</a>, D-N.Y., and Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., urged Bondi to enforce the FACE Act in earnest, albeit citing the abortion services provision.</p><p>In response, Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> condemned the agitators, with a spokesperson telling Fox News: "The governor has repeatedly and unequivocally urged protesters to do so peacefully. While people have a right to speak out, he in no way supports interrupting a place of worship."</p>
