<p>CBS News editor-in-chief <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/60-minutes-host-scott-pelley-reportedly-said-cbs-chief-bari-weiss-needed-take-job-more-seriously" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bari Weiss</a> will hold an all-staff meeting on Tuesday to discuss "the future of CBS News," Fox News Digital has confirmed. </p><p>New York-based staffers will attend live while the meeting will be streamed live to the Washington, London and Los Angeles bureaus. CBS News employees who are out in the field will have an opportunity to join the meeting remotely, and employees were encouraged to submit questions to Weiss in advance. </p><p>Weiss, who was handpicked by CEO David Ellison, was formally named editor-in-chief of CBS News in October after her outlet, The Free Press, was acquired by <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/paramount-skydance-complete-8-billion-merger-fcc-continues-cbs-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paramount</a>. The move was met with both internal and external criticism — with some citing her opinion background and lack of television experience. But others have welcomed the move, noting that CBS News trailed ABC and NBC in most metrics and needed to evolve. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/60-minutes-host-scott-pelley-reportedly-said-cbs-chief-bari-weiss-needed-take-job-more-seriously" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'60 MINUTES' HOST SCOTT PELLEY REPORTEDLY SAID CBS CHIEF BARI WEISS NEEDED TO TAKE JOB MORE 'SERIOUSLY'</strong></a></p><p>Weiss quickly put her stamp on the network, naming Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of "CBS Evening News," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bari-weiss-reportedly-stunned-60-minutes-crew-asking-why-country-thinks-theyre-biased-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questioning staffers</a> about public mistrust in the media, and delaying a "60 Minutes" report on the notorious El Salvador prison CECOT.</p><p>Sharyn Alfonsi, a longtime "60 Minutes" correspondent, sent a note to colleagues fuming over the late December decision by Weiss to hold the story, "Inside CECOT," claiming it was done for political rather than editorial reasons. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bari-weiss-suggests-cecot-60-minutes-piece-she-delayed-wasnt-fair-memo-staffers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>BARI WEISS SUGGESTS CECOT '60 MINUTES' PIECE SHE DELAYED WASN'T 'FAIR' IN MEMO TO STAFFERS</u></strong></a></p><p>Weiss took heat from the left, with outspoken critics claiming she held the story to appease the Trump administration.
