<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/democratic-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic strategist and pundit</a> David Brock called out members of his party in an op-ed for the Washington Post on Thursday over their response to the capture of Nicolás Maduro, as many condemn the Trump administration's actions.</p><p>"Democrats should say this out loud: The United States is allowed to defend itself. It is allowed to put foreign criminals in a U.S. courtroom. If we Democrats seem like we’re defending a narco-state’s sovereignty over American neighborhoods, we deserve to lose," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/08/democrats-venezuela-trump-oil-maduro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brock wrote.</a></p><p>The U.S. carried out strikes in Venezuela on Saturday that led to the capture of Maduro and his wife, who are now <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maduro-appears-us-court-arraignment-questions-swirl-over-venezuelas-fate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing federal charges</a> that include narco-terrorism conspiracy, conspiracy to import cocaine and weapons-related charges.</p><p>"The Biden administration had a $25 million bounty on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro</a>. It wanted him gone. So did most Democrats. But that was then," he added. "After the U.S. captured Maduro, a familiar reflex has kicked in across Democratic politics: oppose first, think later."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-tim-kaine-trumps-venezuela-strike-trampled-congress-war-powers-congress-must-stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SEN TIM KAINE: TRUMP'S VENEZUELA STRIKE TRAMPLED CONGRESS' WAR POWERS. CONGRESS MUST STOP IT</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-label-trumps-venezuela-operation-impeachable-offense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some Democrats have argued</a> the operation amounted to an impeachable offense.</p><p>"This violation of the United States Constitution is an impeachable offense," Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., said in a statement. "I urge my Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives to finally join Democrats in reasserting congressional authority by holding this president accountable for this gross violation of the Constitution."</p><p>Brock pushed back on Democrats labeling the operation illegal, arguing that the facts "shouldn’t be controversial."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mamdani-linked-democratic-socialists-demand-trump-free-maduro-from-lockup-send-him-back-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MAMDANI-LINKED DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS DEMAND TRUMP FREE MADURO FROM LOCKUP — AND SEND HIM BACK TO POWER</strong></a></p><p>"Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a> called this 'a law enforcement operation.' This was not an invasion. It was not an occupation or a coup. It was an arrest raid executed flawlessly with military force to extract the target. Call it what it is. Do not call it Iraq," he wrote.</p><p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> was pressed on comparisons <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-tells-scarborough-us-keep-venezuela-oil-when-pressed-iraq-comparisons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Iraq</a> during a phone call with MS NOW's Joe Scarborough on Tuesday, which the host relayed to his audience.</p><p>"When I pressed comparisons with America’s failed occupation of Iraq, the president’s response was very different. I asked him, I said, ‘Mr. President, when you say, "we’re going to run everything," that obviously causes deep concerns because of the disaster in Iraq.’ The president’s response: 'Joe, the difference between Iraq and this is that Bush didn’t keep the oil. We’re going to keep the oil,'" Scarborough said, quoting Trump.</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</u></strong></a></p><p>Brock shut down the Democrats' argument over congressional approval, which he described as a "loser." He called out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for his response, which he argued "hands Republicans what they want: Democrats sounding more upset about their supposed prerogatives than about American deaths from drug trafficking."</p><p>"So what is the right posture? It is neither reflexive condemnation nor a blank check. It is strength with limits. It is a simple message voters understand: Fine, arrest the narco boss. Now tell us how it ends," Brock wrote.</p>
