The official recognition would land the U.S. a new foothold in the Horn of Africa through a new air and sea base near the entrance of the Red Sea at Berbera Port. </p><p>When asked about the state’s recognition and the potential resettlement of Gazans there, Trump told reporters Aug. 8, "We’re looking into that right now."</p><p>This would position U.S. defense forces directly across from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yemen and the Houthi terrorists</a>, an Iran-backed group prominently known for its attacks against Israel and shipping in the Red Sea.</p><p>Thirty percent of the world’s container ship traffic is reported to pass through its waters en route to or from the Suez Canal, according to previous Fox News Digital reports.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/yemen-separatist-forces-seize-key-oil-region-urge-us-partner-against-iran-backed-houthis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>YEMEN SEPARATIST FORCES SEIZE KEY OIL REGION, URGE US TO PARTNER AGAINST IRAN-BACKED HOUTHIS</strong></a></p><p>Trump is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu Monday, Dec. 29, at his Mar-a-Lago residence to discuss "next steps" in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions?9641128&amp;page=122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaza peace deal</a>. </p><p>Despite previous talks, Trump is reportedly, "not ready" to embrace Somaliland's independence and was reportedly "unimpressed" by its expressed interest in joining the Abraham Accords.</p><p>Trump told the New York Post he has to "study" Netanyahu's pitch and asked from his golf course, "Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?"</p><p>"We’ll study it. I study a lot of things and always make great decisions, and they turn out to be correct," Trump told the Post.</p><p>Somalia has been battling Islamist fundamentalist fighters for decades, with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Africa Command increasing attacks</a> against ISIS and al-Shabab terrorists, according to previous Fox News Digital reporting.</p><p>The breakaway has allegedly "eliminated radicalism" and it has aligned itself with the U.S. Somaliland Minister of the Presidency Khadar Hussein Abdi said that, for over three decades, Somaliland has "remained democratic, peaceful and self-governing — unlike Somalia.</p><p>"It’s time for Somalia to focus on its own challenges and to be constructive. The illusion of Somali unity ended long ago." Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991.</p><p>Netanyahu reportedly invited Abdullahi to Israel and "praised his leadership and commitment to promoting stability and peace."</p>
