<p>Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., asserted Monday in a post on X that President Donald Trump is "mentally ill" and should be "immediately" removed from office via the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-is-25th-amendment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25th Amendment</a>.</p><p>"The president of the United States is extremely mentally ill and it’s putting all of our lives at risk. The 25th Amendment exists for a reason — we need to invoke it immediately," she declared <a href="https://x.com/RepYassAnsari/status/2013377798493090246" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in the post.</a></p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> for comment on Tuesday morning.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-warns-us-can-no-longer-think-purely-peace-he-pushes-greenland-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP WARNS US CAN NO LONGER THINK ‘PURELY OF PEACE’ AS HE PUSHES FOR GREENLAND CONTROL</strong></a></p><p>The congresswoman made the comment in response to a letter from President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.</p><p>"Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America," Trump asserted in the message.</p><p>"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway?" he continued, referring to Greenland. "There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!"

Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter. We also support that NATO in a responsible way is taking steps to strengthen security and stability in the Arctic. As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government," Støre noted.</p><p>Sen. <a href="https://x.com/SenMarkey/status/2013282409463063000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ed Markey,</a> D-Mass., and Rep.
