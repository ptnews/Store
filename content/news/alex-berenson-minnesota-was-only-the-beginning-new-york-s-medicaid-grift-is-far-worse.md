<p>It's not just Minnesota. Or just daycares. The deepest government honeypot is blue-state Medicaid.</p><p>And nowhere does corruption run deeper than in New<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> York State</a>, where everyone wants a piece of a $120 billion honeypot.</p><p>You’ve seen the video.</p><p>Nick Shirley, a citizen journalist (aka a journalist), traveled around Minnesota looking for fraud at state-funded daycare centers largely run by Somali immigrants. He found obvious evidence of malfeasance — and attracted a worldwide audience on X.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-blue-state-fraud-scandals-highlight-shocking-reality-red-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DAVID MARCUS: BLUE STATE FRAUD SCANDALS HIGHLIGHT SHOCKING REALITY IN RED STATES</strong></a></p><p>Shirley’s 42-minute video has now been viewed more than 115 million times, even forcing a huffy response from Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> (last seen exaggerating his military service).</p><p>Shirley deserves the attention. But when it comes to waste, fraud and abuse in government programs, nothing holds a candle to healthcare spending. Especially in blue states, and especially since the Affordable Care Act and then COVID-era federal subsidies allowed expanded Medicaid coverage with an endless federal backstop.</p><p>And nowhere is this more evident than in New York.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-not-just-minnesota-democrats-have-created-welfare-fraud-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IT'S NOT JUST MINNESOTA.

The email began:</p><p>"I have a friend who drives a taxi in XXX NY. He estimates that 80% of the cab fares are paid for by Medicaid…</p><p>"Yesterday, he made a round tripper from XXX to Boston where a child had a two-hour appointment at Boston’s Shriners [Children’s] Hospital. The fare? $1,058.37 — EACH way. $2,116.74 in total."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmaker-unveils-walz-act-after-billions-lost-in-minnesota-fraud-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOP LAWMAKER UNVEILS WALZ ACT AFTER BILLIONS LOST IN MINNESOTA FRAUD SCANDAL</strong></a></p><p>It appears this was not a direct pay/bill to Medicaid, but a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital pay</a> from a fund they have for such "needs". I think we can safely assume these funds are either backed by state of federal dollars at the end of the day. His take? 37% — $783.</p><p>Attached to the email was a photo of the fare. The unusual name on it matches the unusual name of a child from a refugee family who was publicly reported injured in an odd accident.</p><p>The city where the child lives has several hospitals.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-surges-resources-minnesota-director-patel-calls-250m-fraud-scheme-tip-iceberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FBI SURGES RESOURCES TO MINNESOTA AS PATEL CALLS $250M FRAUD SCHEME 'TIP OF ICEBERG'</strong></a></p><p>What exactly is this hospital in a different state providing — especially when getting to an appointment and back requires a full day in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/transportation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back of a taxi</a>?</p><p>How much is all of this care costing, if a single appointment costs $2,100 — the cost of a round-trip business-class, cross-country plane ticket — for transportation alone (before whatever markup the hospital is adding)?</p><p>And who is paying for all this care for a penniless refugee family from one of the poorest countries in the world?</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/feds-launch-massive-investigation-after-viral-video-alleges-minnesota-daycare-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FEDS LAUNCH 'MASSIVE' INVESTIGATION AFTER VIRAL VIDEO ALLEGES MINNESOTA DAYCARE FRAUD</strong></a></p><p>The first two questions have no answer.</p><p>The third does, however. Local (in New York, counties and New York City contribute to Medicaid), state — and most of all — federal<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/federal-relations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> taxpayers</a>. And the spending is skyrocketing unstoppably.</p><p>Year after year, conservative think tanks — and sometimes even non-partisan good government groups — write papers about how out-of-control New York’s Medicaid program has become. Year after year, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican lawmakers</a> at the state and federal level complain. Sometimes, state and federal prosecutors even attack particularly egregious fraud.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/red-state-governor-touts-medicaid-savings-minnesota-grapples-widespread-fraud-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RED STATE GOVERNOR TOUTS MEDICAID SAVINGS AS MINNESOTA GRAPPLES WITH WIDESPREAD FRAUD ALLEGATIONS</strong></a></p><p>But nothing ever changes, except that the numbers get larger.</p><p>In 1988, New York had about 18 million people and spent about $10 billion on Medicaid. Today, the state has about 20 million people — and spends about $120 billion. Even after adjusting for inflation, New York is spending about four times as much per person.</p><p>In fact, after a period of somewhat slower growth in the 2000s, spending has recently accelerated again — mainly because the state’s Democratic politicians have realized that the federal government will backstop more and more spending.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</strong></a></p><p>I expect to have more to say about New York’s Medicaid program in future articles, because it is impossible to unravel the crisis in American medicine from the crisis in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/regulation/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American medical spending — and</a> the honeypot New York has created captures the essence of the problem.</p><p>If every state spent at the same level as New York, the United States would spend about $2 trillion on Medicaid alone — yet there is no evidence that patients in New York are healthier or receive better care than those in states that spend far less.</p><p>I am more convinced than ever that the system’s out-of-control financial incentives aren’t just putting the entire federal government on a fast track to financial ruin — they are leading to worse care for many, many Americans.</p><p>The road to hell is paved with $2,100 cab rides.</p><p><i>Editor's note: This column first appeared on the author's Substack, "</i><a href="https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/its-not-just-minnesota-or-just-daycares" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Unreported Truths</i></a><i>."</i></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/alex-berenson" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ALEX BERENSON</strong></a></p>
