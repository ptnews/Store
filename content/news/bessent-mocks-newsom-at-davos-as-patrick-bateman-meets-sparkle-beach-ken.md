<p>Treasury Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/scott-bessent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Bessent</a> lashed out at California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday, calling him "economically illiterate" and accusing him of prioritizing elite global gatherings over the state’s mounting fiscal, housing, and homelessness crises.</p><p>Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Bessent used the high-profile meeting to deliver a blistering critique of Newsom’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economic record and leadership</a>.</p><p>"I was told he was asked to give a speech on his signature policies, but he's not speaking because what have his economic policies brought? Outward migration from California, a gigantic budget deficit, the largest homeless population in America, and the poor folks in the Palisades who had their homes burned down," the Treasury secretary said.</p><p>"He is here hobnobbing with the global elite while his California citizens are still homeless. Shame on him. He's too smug, too self-absorbed, and too economically illiterate to know anything."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-touts-californias-numerous-legal-fights-trump-administration-final-state-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEWSOM TOUTS CALIFORNIA’S NUMEROUS LEGAL FIGHTS WITH TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN FINAL STATE OF THE STATE</strong></a></p><p>Bessent also responded to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gavin-newsom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsom's</a> characterization of him as a "smug man," saying the governor "strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken," referring to the fictional serial killer from "American Psycho" and the flamboyant doll character from "Barbie."</p><p>"[He] may be the only Californian who knows less about economics than <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kamala Harris</a>. He's here this week with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros, and Davos is the perfect place for a man who, when everyone else was on lockdown, when he was having people arrested for going to church, he was having $1,000 a night meals at the French Laundry," he added. "And I'm sure the California people won't forget that."</p><p>The Cabinet official said the administration would also move to address what he called "waste, fraud and abuse" in the state.</p><p>Newsom, who is in Switzerland <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-warns-pathetic-foreign-leaders-grow-backbone-bizarre-takedown-likening-trump-t-rex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attending the Davos summit</a>, struck back at the White House on Tuesday by directing his criticism at President Donald Trump and his remarks about acquiring Greenland.</p><p>"America’s allies and business leaders need to understand this: There’s no diplomacy with Donald Trump. Get off your knees and grow a spine," he wrote on X.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-touts-californias-numerous-legal-fights-trump-administration-final-state-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEWSOM TOUTS CALIFORNIA'S NUMEROUS LEGAL FIGHTS WITH TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN FINAL STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS</strong></a></p><p>He told reporters on the sidelines of the annual meeting later that Trump is a "T. rex." "You mate with him or he devours you. One or the other," Newsom said.</p><p>"It’s time to stand tall and firm. Have a backbone. I can’t take this complicity — people rolling over," he added. "From an American perspective, it’s embarrassing."</p>
