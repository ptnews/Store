<p>January feels like a reset. A new calendar. New goals. New habits. While you clean out your inbox, organize paperwork or set resolutions, however, scammers also hit reset, and they start with your personal data.</p><p>That is because January is one of the most important months for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online privacy</a>. This is when data brokers refresh profiles and scammers rebuild their target lists.</p><p>As a result, the longer your information stays online, the more complete and valuable your profile becomes. To help address this, institutions like the U.S. Department of the Treasury have released advisories urging people to stay vigilant and avoid data-related scams. </p><p>For that reason, taking action early in the year can significantly reduce scam attempts, lower identity theft risks, and limit unwanted exposure for the rest of the year.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong><br>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

Unfortunately, that's not how data brokers work.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/make-2026-your-most-private-year-yet-removing-broker-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>Data brokers</u> </a>don't just store a snapshot of who you are today. They build living profiles that grow over time, pulling from:</p><p>Each year adds another layer. A new address. A changed phone number. A family connection. A retirement milestone. On its own, one data point doesn't mean much. But together, they create a detailed identity profile that scammers can use to convincingly impersonate you. That's why waiting makes things worse, not better.</p><p>Scammers don't randomly target people. They work from lists. At the beginning of the year, those lists get refreshed.</p><p>Think of it like the upcoming spring cleaning, except it's criminals organizing identities to exploit for the next 12 months.</p><p>Once your profile is flagged as responsive or profitable, it often stays in circulation.</p><p>Removing your data early isn't just about stopping scams today; it's about cutting off the supply chain that fuels them. When your information is removed from data broker databases:</p><p>This has a compounding benefit in the opposite direction. The fewer lists you appear on in January, the fewer times your data gets reused, resold, and recycled throughout the year. That's why I consistently recommend addressing data exposure before problems start, not after.</p><p>January is especially important for retirees and families because they're <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-data-brokers-fueling-elder-fraud-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>more likely to become targets </u></a>of fraud, scams, and other crimes.</p><p>Scammers know this. That's why households with established financial histories are prioritized early in the year.</p><p>Many people try to "start fresh" in January by:</p><p>Those steps help, but they don't remove your data from broker databases. Credit monitoring services alert you after something goes wrong. Password changes don't affect public profiles. And unsubscribing doesn't stop data resale. If your personal information is still sitting in hundreds of databases, scammers can find you.</p><p>If you want fewer scam attempts for the rest of the year, the most effective step is removing your personal data at the source.</p><p>You can do this in one of two ways. You can submit removal requests yourself, or you can use a professional data removal service to handle the process for you.</p><p>Manually removing your data means identifying dozens or even hundreds of data broker websites, finding their opt-out forms and submitting removal requests one by one. You also need to verify your identity, track responses and repeat the process whenever your information reappears.</p><p>This approach works, but it requires time, organization, and ongoing follow-up.</p><p>A data removal service handles this process on your behalf. These services typically:</p><p>Because these services handle sensitive personal information, it is important to choose one that follows strict security standards and uses verified removal methods.</p><p>While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/retirees-lose-millions-fake-holiday-charities-scammers-exploit-seasonal-generosity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RETIREES LOSE MILLIONS TO FAKE HOLIDAY CHARITIES AS SCAMMERS EXPLOIT SEASONAL GENEROSITY</strong></a></p><p>Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting <i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p><strong>Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: </strong><i><strong><u>Cyberguy.com.</u></strong></i></p><p>Scammers don't wait for mistakes. They wait for exposed data. January is when profiles are refreshed, lists are rebuilt, and targets are chosen for the year ahead. The longer your personal information stays online, the more complete-and dangerous-your digital profile becomes. The good news? You can stop the cycle. Removing your data now reduces scam attempts, protects your identity, and gives you a quieter, safer year ahead. If you're going to make one privacy move this year, make it early-and make it count.</p><p>Have you ever been surprised by how much of your personal information was already online?
