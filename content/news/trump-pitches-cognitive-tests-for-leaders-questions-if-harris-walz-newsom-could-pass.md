<p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> floated that all presidents and vice presidents should take cognitive tests, days after bragging that he successfully completed a third cognitive exam. </p><p>Trump, 79, has frequently taken aim at former President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> amid multiple books and reports detailing the decline of Biden’s mental faculties while in office, and similarly cast doubt on whether other Democrats could pass a cognitive test. </p><p>"Do you think Walz could pass a cognitive test … Do you think Kamala could?" Trump said Tuesday at the Kennedy Center for the House GOP Member Retreat. "I don’t think Gavin could. He’s got a good line of crap, but other than that, he couldn’t pass." </p><p>Trump was referring to former Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kamala Harris</a>, Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz </a>and California Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gavin-newsom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gavin Newsom</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-inside-trumps-private-schedule-media-fixates-his-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>EXCLUSIVE: INSIDE TRUMP’S PRIVATE SCHEDULE AS MEDIA FIXATES ON HIS HEALTH</strong></a></p><p>Spokespeople for Harris and Walz did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tag/fox-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News</a> Digital. </p><p>In response to a request for comment, Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon replied to Fox News Digital: "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA." </p><p>Trump’s statements come after he claimed he "ACED" another <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive examination</a>, and backs mandatory cognitive exams to prevent "'STUPID' or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!" from leading the country. </p><p>"The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in "PERFECT HEALTH," and that I "ACED" (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take," Trump posted to Truth Social Friday.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-scolds-new-york-times-creeps-over-hit-piece-questioning-his-energy-levels-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP SCOLDS NEW YORK TIMES AS 'CREEPS' OVER ‘HIT PIECE’ QUESTIONING HIS ENERGY LEVELS, SCHEDULE</strong></a></p><p>Trump also said Tuesday that he faces a catch-22 when it comes to completing a medical exam — or not — amid <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent questions surrounding his health</a>. For example, concern has stemmed from bruising on his hands and reports regarding swollen ankles. </p><p>"If I don't do a medical exam, they say, ‘Trump’s not doing an exam. There must be something wrong with him.’ If I do the exam, they say, ‘Why did he do this? Why did he do this part of an exam? He did too much. There's something wrong with him,’" Trump said. </p><p>Trump’s comments come as he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-regrets-handing-dems-health-ammunition-october-scan-clarifies-ct-not-mri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified to The Wall Street Journal</a> in a piece published Thursday that he received a CT scan, and not a more thorough, time-consuming MRI scan, for a medical examination he underwent in October. Trump said in the interview that he regrets taking the CT scan because it provided "ammunition" to those who have questioned his overall health. </p><p>The October visit came after Trump’s annual physical at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walter Reed National Military Medical Center</a> in Maryland. Afterward, White House physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, claimed that the president "remains in excellent health."</p><p>Meanwhile, the White House press secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/karoline-leavitt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karoline Leavitt</a> has dismissed questions about Trump’s bruised hands and attributed the markings in July to "frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin." Likewise, she said that Trump’s swollen legs are a "benign and common condition" that sometimes plagues those over the age of 70. </p><p><i>Fox News’ Emma Colton contributed to this report. </i></p>
