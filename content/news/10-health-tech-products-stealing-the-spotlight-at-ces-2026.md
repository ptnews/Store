Samsung emphasizes that Brain Health is not intended to diagnose medical conditions. Instead, it aims to provide early warnings that encourage people and their families to seek professional evaluation sooner.</p><p>Samsung plans for future beta availability, but no public release date has been confirmed. At CES 2026, people can check out the feature during an in-person demo.</p><p>Withings is rethinking what a bathroom scale can do with BodyScan 2, which earned a CES 2026 Innovation Award.
