<p>Fifty-seven<strong> </strong>Republicans voted with the vast majority of Democrats on Thursday to keep a Biden-era mandate enabling government remote control of vehicles, drawing backlash from conservatives like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. </p><p>The group voted to defeat an amendment proposed by Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., that would have rolled back <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government requirements</a> for the development of a "kill switch" to disable the cars of impaired drivers.</p><p>That amendment failed by a 164-268 vote.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-funding-heads-house-vote-after-johnson-quells-gop-revolt-over-ethanol" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DHS FUNDING HEADS TO HOUSE VOTE AFTER JOHNSON QUELLS GOP REVOLT OVER ETHANOL</strong></a></p><p>If successful, the amendment would have been folded into a much larger bill to fund the departments of War, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Health and Human Services. That larger package went on to pass <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the chamber</a> in a bipartisan 341-88 vote on Thursday.</p><p>DeSantis, who has championed small-government policies in the Sunshine State, blasted the amendment vote <a href="https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/2014500133971296434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>in a post to X</u></a> on Friday morning.</p><p>"The idea that the federal government would require auto manufacturers to equip cars with a ‘kill switch’ that can be controlled by the government is something you’d expect in Orwell’s 1984," DeSantis said, referring to the fictional novel by George Orwell warning readers against totalitarianism.</p><p>DeSantis’ frustration echoed that of other lawmakers who were left concerned.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ice-funding-bill-draws-fire-from-left-right-shutdown-deadline-nears" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE FUNDING BILL DRAWS FIRE FROM LEFT AND RIGHT AS SHUTDOWN DEADLINE NEARS</strong></a></p><p>"Unbelievably disturbing," Rep.
