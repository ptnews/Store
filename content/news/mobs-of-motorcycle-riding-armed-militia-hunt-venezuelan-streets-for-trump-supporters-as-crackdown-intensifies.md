<p>In the aftermath of Nicolás Maduro’s capture by United States forces, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paramilitary groups tied to the Venezuelan</a> leader’s regime have initiated an aggressive campaign to maintain control over the country.</p><p>Mobs of motorcycle-riding civilians often armed with assault rifles, known as colectivos, have been conducting intrusive searches and establishing checkpoints to identify and punish anyone showing support for Maduro’s removal from power, Reuters reported.</p><p>The National Union of Press Workers of Venezuela reported that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/armed-forces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armed forces</a> briefly detained fourteen journalists during Monday's induction of Vice President Delcy Rodríguez as the country’s interim leader. Residents have also reported that some Venezuelans have been afraid to leave their homes, fearing that armed forces would seize and scour their phones for signs of dissent, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2026/01/06/venezuela-police-door-to-door-maduro-arrest/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Telegraph</a> said.</p><p>"The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in <a href="https://archive.is/o/9vTh8/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/venezuela/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuela</a>, so we don’t know what’s going to happen, time will tell," Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.</p><p>The colectivos are largely controlled by Nicolás Maduro’s close ally, Diosdado Cabello, who has a $25 million bounty from the U.S. State Department largely for his role in corruption and drug trafficking.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/venezuelas-new-interim-leader-delcy-rodriguez-hates-west-former-official-warns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VENEZUELA'S NEW INTERIM LEADER DELCY RODRÍGUEZ 'HATES THE WEST,' EX OFFICIAL WARNS</strong></a></p><p>Cabello, who serves as the state's Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, is widely known for suppressing political dissent in Venezuela. The presence of colectivos, who often serve as an unofficial arm of state repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately trying to maintain their grip on the country.</p><p>The reported crackdown began with a government directive to root out dissent against the Venezuelan regime. According to Reuters, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/venezuela-orders-nationwide-manhunt-supporters-after-maduros-arrest-us-forces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state of emergency decree</a> published on Monday ordered police to "immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support of the armed attack by the United States."</p><p>As someone who conducts state-run domestic espionage through widespread coordination of surveillance and counterintelligence agencies, Cabello remains a major unpredictable and dangerous figure in the wake of Maduro’s capture, Reuters reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/from-palace-prison-venezuelan-strongman-maduro-locked-troubled-brooklyn-jail" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FROM PALACE TO PRISON: VENEZUELAN STRONGMAN MADURO LOCKED IN TROUBLED BROOKLYN JAIL</strong></a></p><p>"The focus is now on Diosdado Cabello," Venezuelan military strategist Jose Garcia told the outlet.
