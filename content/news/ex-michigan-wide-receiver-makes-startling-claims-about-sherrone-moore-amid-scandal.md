<p>Former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/michigan-wolverines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan Wolverines</a> wide receiver Anthony Simpson made startling claims about his playing time when he was at the school in relation to the Sherrone Moore scandal.</p><p>Moore was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fired-michigan-football-coach-sherrone-moore-faces-charges-stalking-home-invasion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired by Michigan in December</a> after the school said he had an "inappropriate relationship" with a staffer. He was later arrested after an incident with the woman following his dismissal. Michigan hired Kyle Whittingham to replace him as head coach.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Simpson transferred to Michigan from Massachusetts before the 2025 season. But he got minimal playing time and entered the transfer portal once more after receiving one more year of eligibility.</p><p>He claimed in since-deleted posts on X that his playing time was affected due to players allegedly blackmailing Moore because of his alleged extramarital affairs, according to <a href="https://www.si.com/college/michigan/football/former-michigan-players-paint-troubling-picture-of-program-under-sherrone-moore" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sports Illustrated</a>.</p><p>"If I kept my mouth closed no one would know that I was a part of a scandal that impacted the team and impacted my chance to add to my production in college," he wrote on social media. "Tried to stay at Michigan but the ‘GM’ [Sean Magee] said there wasn’t a roster spot for me. God has plans for us all and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me. Thank you Michigan.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/michigan-qb-bryce-underwood-remain-program-after-sherrone-moore-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MICHIGAN QB BRYCE UNDERWOOD TO REMAIN WITH PROGRAM AFTER SHERRONE MOORE SCANDAL</strong></a></p><p>"Targets vs non targets, I was the best slot receiver for Michigan and I was treated unfairly due to [Sherrone] Moore being blackmailed by players and staff members. Which jeopardized my opportunity to get on the field. Fastest player on the team and I won reps every day in practice. Only there for fall camp. Our team captains also advocated for me to play. I was denied fairness."</p><p>Former Michigan players Cristian Dixon and Raheem Anderson appeared to co-sign Simpson’s posts.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Michigan for comment.</p><p>Simpson has since transferred to Toledo.</p><p>Michigan will look to start fresh in 2026 as the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/sherrone-moore-had-long-history-domestic-violence-against-michigan-staffer-attorney-alleges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore case unravels in court</a>.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
