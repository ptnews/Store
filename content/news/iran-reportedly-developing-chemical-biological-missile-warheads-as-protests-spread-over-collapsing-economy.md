<p>Iran is reportedly developing chemical and biological warheads for its ballistic missiles, even as the country faces mounting domestic unrest fueled by a collapsing currency and soaring inflation, according to an exclusive report published by Iran International on Sunday.</p><p>The outlet, citing unnamed military and security sources, reported that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps</a> has accelerated work on unconventional missile payloads alongside upgrades to command-and-control systems. If confirmed, the developments would raise serious alarms in Washington and Israel, particularly as Tehran struggles to contain growing anger at home.</p><p>The report comes as Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> meets with President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> on Monday, with Iran’s missile program and broader regional security threats expected to be high on the agenda, according to Israeli and U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. The talks are also expected to address the war in Gaza, amid U.S. officials’ concerns that Netanyahu has delayed advancing a postwar framework and ceasefire-related steps. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-fires-ballistic-cruise-missiles-simulated-targets-near-persian-gulf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN FIRES BALLISTIC AND CRUISE MISSILES AT SIMULATED TARGETS NEAR PERSIAN GULF</strong></a></p><p>According to Iran International, missile infrastructure has been repositioned and expanded, with some launch assets reportedly moved to eastern Iran to reduce vulnerability. The report claims the IRGC is exploring nonconventional warhead configurations for long-range missiles.</p><p>Tehran has long denied pursuing chemical or biological weapons, insisting its missile program is defensive. Iran is a signatory to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/global-economy/treaties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chemical Weapons Convention</a>, though Western governments have repeatedly accused the Islamic Republic of violating international norms.</p><p>The missile report coincides with escalating economic unrest inside Iran. <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202512296324" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Iran International</a> reported Monday that shopkeepers in Tehran shut down major markets for a second consecutive day, protesting inflation and the collapse of the national currency.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/from-gaza-iran-whats-stake-trump-netanyahu-mar-a-lago-talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FROM GAZA TO IRAN: WHAT’S AT STAKE IN TRUMP-NETANYAHU MAR-A-LAGO TALKS?</strong></a></p><p>A <a href="https://http://x.com/en_simayazadi/status/2005637030970294332?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video from Tehran</a> posted on Simay Azadi’s TV X page on Monday showed a large crowd marching in the streets and chanting slogans against the regime.</p><p>An Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, said the strikes spread across multiple commercial districts, including the Gold Bazaar and central arcades, with crowds gathering in surrounding streets. The group also claimed security forces linked to the IRGC were placed on heightened alert in Tehran, with additional units on standby in nearby provinces. The claims could not be independently verified.</p><p>In a statement, Maryam Rajavi, NCRI president-elect, said the protests reflected public anger over high prices, inflation and political repression, and called on Iranians to support the striking merchants.</p><p>The Iranian rial has fallen to a new record low against the U.S. dollar. Official data show year-on-year inflation reached 52.6% in December, while average annual inflation was 42.2%. Videos circulating online show chants against government officials and growing frustration among merchants, a group traditionally viewed as a key pillar of regime support.</p>
