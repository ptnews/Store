To help out in your search, here are a few answers to the most commonly asked questions consumers have when buying a new mattress online.</p><p>Picking out the best mattress brand will depend entirely on your specific needs, preferences and budget. The brands featured in our guide consistently receive high ratings and are well-regarded for different reasons. Many of these mattress brands offer mattress quizzes that can help guide you to options based on your preferences.</p><p>How long your mattress lasts depends on the quality of the mattress and how you care for it. You will know it's time to replace your mattress if you see signs of visible sagging or deep body impressions. Another good indicator signaling that your mattress is likely to no longer provide adequate support is if you consistently wake up with back, neck, hip or shoulder pain that wasn't there before. An old mattress can accumulate dust mites, mold and allergens, leading to increased allergy symptoms.</p><p>Choosing the best mattress depends on individual needs and preferences. Side sleepers generally do better with a softer to medium-firm mattress that contours to their body to relieve pressure on hips and shoulders and maintain spinal alignment. Back sleepers may prefer a medium to firm mattress that provides consistent support to keep the neck, shoulders and torso aligned. Stomach sleepers should opt for a firmer mattress to prevent their hips from sinking too far, which can lead to back pain.</p><p><strong>If you’re an </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=ng-57-20&amp;linkId=06968342e4428d70bc868746f8dd2bd7&amp;lan" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener"><strong>Amazon Prime member</strong></a><strong>, you can get these items sent to your door ASAP.
