<p>Republican Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/wesley-hunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wesley Hunt</a> of Texas is calling for the complete and permanent abolition of diversity, equity and inclusion ideology, noting that he only wants to be judged based on his "character," "competence" and "results."</p><p>"DEI should be abolished, permanently. I never want to be chosen, promoted, or rewarded because of how I look. I want to earn every opportunity on merit, through hard work, grit, discipline, and determination," the Army veteran declared in a <a href="https://x.com/WesleyHuntTX/status/2006529464881041788" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> on X.</p><p>"Equality means equal standards, not engineered outcomes. The dignity of achievement comes from effort, not entitlement. Judge me by my character, my competence, and my results. Anything less is an insult to everyone striving to be their best," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/army-veteran-maga-rising-star-jumps-into-fiery-gop-senate-primary-polls-tighten" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ARMY VETERAN-TURNED-MAGA RISING STAR JUMPS INTO FIERY GOP SENATE PRIMARY AS POLLS TIGHTEN</strong></a></p><p>Billionaire business tycoon <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> heartily endorsed the lawmaker's comments.</p><p>"And this is how anyone of honor should be!"
