"Proceedings must be conducted without leniency, compassion or indulgence." </p><p>U.S. Secretary of State <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Rubio</a> offered support for the protesters.</p><p>"The United States supports the brave people of Iran," Rubio wrote Saturday on X. </p><p><i>Fox News’ Efrat Lachter and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i> </p>
