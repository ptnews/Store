"We also want to expand this. We know that the fraud isn't just happening in Minneapolis. It's also happening in states like Ohio. It's happening in states like California."</p><p>Vance made the announcement alongside White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt at a Thursday briefing.</p><p>Prior to Vance's remarks, Leavitt reiterated the administration's rock-solid support for federal immigration officers operating across the country.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-look-defunding-ice-impeaching-sec-noem-after-minneapolis-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>DEMOCRATS LOOK AT DEFUNDING ICE, IMPEACHING NOEM AFTER MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING</u></strong></a></p><p>Addressing the deadly officer-involved shooting in Minnesota on Wednesday, she blamed the incident on an "organized attack" by a "broader left-wing network" on federal officers operating in multiple states.</p><p>The statement echoed comments from Homeland Security Secretary <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kristi-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Kristi Noem</u></a> said the victim, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to "weaponize her vehicle" and "attempted to run a law enforcement officer over."</p><p>Noem also accused Good of "stalking and impeding" federal agents all day.

Vance said Younes' arguments were "preposterous."</p><p>"The gaslighting is off the charts, and I'm having none of it. This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job. When he approached her car, she tried to hit him," <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/2009255599268130914" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>Vance wrote</u></a>. "A tragedy? Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with."</p><p><i>This is a developing story.
