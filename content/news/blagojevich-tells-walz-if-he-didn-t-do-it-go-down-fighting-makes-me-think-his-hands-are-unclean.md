<p>Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who said he knows what it's like being accused of corruption, hammered Minnesota Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Walz</a> for "quitting" his reelection, which the Trump-friendly Democrat said suggests "his hands are unclean" in fraud scandals.</p><p>Walz, a Democrat, said Monday that he would not be seeking a third term, after consulting with his family and political team.</p><p>Blagojevich was impeached by the Illinois State Senate and removed from office in January 2009 as he battled corruption charges. He was later imprisoned for 14 years before having his sentence commuted by President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>. He later received a pardon but remains barred from holding Illinois office.</p><p>That saga appeared to lead the Democrat to slam Walz’ positioning as he too prepares to leave office next year.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/james-comer-accuse-tim-walz-being-asleep-wheel-fraud-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JAMES COMER TO ACCUSE TIM WALZ OF BEING 'ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL' AT FRAUD HEARING</strong></a></p><p>"I’m no stranger to being accused of wrongdoing," <a href="https://x.com/realBlagojevich/status/2008668684156371314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Blagojevich said</a> on social media.</p><p>"[B]ut if you didn’t do it, the honorable thing to do is to fight.
