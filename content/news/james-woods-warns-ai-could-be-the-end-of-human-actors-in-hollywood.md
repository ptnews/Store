<p>Oscar-nominated actor James Woods delivered a stark warning about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a> in Hollywood, saying it is not a passing fad but a force that could someday spell the end of human actors.</p><p>"AI is the end of human actors. I'm adamant about this," Woods said Sunday on "One Nation with Brian Kilmeade."</p><p>"People say, 'You're overreacting'… when the silent [movies] went to talkies. People said, 'Oh it's a fad.' When television came in, 'It won't replace movies.'"</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/ai-technology-race-new-cold-war-between-us-china-could-have-devastating-consequences-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>AI TECHNOLOGY RACE IS NEW 'COLD WAR' BETWEEN US AND CHINA THAT COULD HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>He argued that film companies will look to cut red tape where possible, skipping actors' agents, entourages, lucrative contracts and more in favor of AI-generated replacements, but there are a few speed bumps hindering the process.</p><p>"It's not going to work [right now] because we have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie stars</a> we like," he said. </p><p>"We love brilliant actors like Brad Pitt, we love Meryl Streep, all these great actors because we grew up with them, but when the next generation grows up with a computer-generated model, they will be as realistic as people."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ben-affleck-confident-ai-cannot-replace-hollywood-movies-reason" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>BEN AFFLECK IS CONFIDENT AI CANNOT REPLACE HOLLYWOOD MOVIES FOR THIS REASON</u></strong></a></p><p>Woods cited Moore's Law — the longstanding observation that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/computers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computing power</a> tends to double roughly every 18 months — as evidence that such realism is approaching faster than many expect.</p><p>He argued that such rapid advances would enable filmmakers to churn out content 24 hours a day at a cheaper price.</p><p>"When Steven Spielberg did the first ‘Jurassic Park,’ people said, 'This is amazing… How can he have done it?' He goes, ‘In five years, 14-year-old kids will be doing this on their Macintosh.’ And he was right. </p><p>"Maybe it was a couple years more or a couple of years less, but it's astonishing how quickly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it's changing</a>."</p>
