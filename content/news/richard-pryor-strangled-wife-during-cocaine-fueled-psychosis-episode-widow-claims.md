And he said, 'You're gonna die.'"</p><p>She added, "And I said, 'Richard?' And I had a cross around my neck and I grabbed it. And I said, 'Give me the words. Give me the words.'"</p><p>"And I calmed him down. I talked him off the ledge. I said, 'Everything is going to be OK. There's no need for any violence here. Everything's going to be fine,'" she said.</p><p>"And he had his hands around my neck at one point during this episode. And I calmed him down. I went and got my slacks, put on my slacks and I hightailed out of there."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>When Mandel stated that she always seemed to go<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/couples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> back to him</a>, Jennifer agreed.</p><p>Richard, known as a comedian and actor, won five Grammy Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award during his career. </p><p>He starred in "Stir Crazy," "Silver Streak," "See No Evil, Hear No Evil," "Harlem Nights" and more.</p><p>Richard also hosted his own shows: "The Richard Pryor Show" and "Pryor's Place."</p><p>Richard and Jennifer first married in August 1981, but their marriage lasted only 14 days.

Kept loaded. And one night, he shot off three rounds. One on the bedroom wall. One in the ceiling. And another ... I was at that point, in the front hall ... back hall vestibule. He had the gun behind his back and he shot off another round."</p><p>"And then he brings it forward, and I'm counting how many bullets are in the gun. And he cocks the trigger, and he says, 'Get out, b----.' Cocked it. And I said, 'No problem.' Walked outside. Sat on the back step. Had a cigarette. Ten minutes later, I walk back in."</p><p>She continued, "He's in the bedroom. I said, 'What was that about?' And he said, 'Oh, I'm so glad you didn't make me shoot you.'"</p><p>She explained that the Reiner murder triggered her because she was so codependent on Richard that she thinks she could have died.</p><p>"I'm lucky to be here," she said.</p>
