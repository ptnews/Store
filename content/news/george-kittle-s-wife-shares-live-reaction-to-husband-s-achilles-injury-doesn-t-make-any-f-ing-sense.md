<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Francisco 49ers</a> fans suffered a devastating blow when George Kittle went down with a torn Achilles on Sunday, but the star tight end's wife may have taken it the hardest.</p><p>Claire Kittle and Kyle Juszczyk’s wife, Kristin, have shared their game-day memories on an Instagram page called "Wifed Up Mic'd Up," and the page caught Claire's live reaction to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/49ers-george-kittle-carted-off-field-achilles-injury-during-wild-card-round-vs-eagles-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her husband's injury</a>.</p><p>"Get up. Get up," Claire begged as her husband lay on the grass at Lincoln Financial Field.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>Someone else in their suite said to Claire that it was likely an Achilles injury after seeing a replay. She then let out an emphatic, "F---," and watched in shock as her husband was carted off the field.</p><p>"It's all f---ing f---ed up. What's that, a year?" Claire asked. "All next year, too. Doesn't make any f---ing sense."</p><p>The video then told viewers that the Kittles spent the rest of the game in the locker room together.</p><p>Despite the injury, Kittle was in "good spirits," probably because of the Niners’ <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/49ers-eliminate-defending-super-bowl-champion-eagles-from-playoffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23-19 victory to advance</a> to the divisional round. He was then seen on camera belting out "Linger" by The Cranberries and "One Headlight" by The Wallflowers on a bus to the airport.</p><p>"See you next year," Kittle told the cameras.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fox-super-6-contest-chris-the-bear-fallicas-nfl-divisional-round-predictions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOX SUPER 6 CONTEST: CHRIS 'THE BEAR' FALLICA'S NFL DIVISIONAL ROUND PREDICTIONS</strong></a></p><p>"Disbelief and stillness were all I felt as I yelled, get up, get up, over and over again. He always gets up. He’s George — he can do all things. He just does it. It hurts. There’s no preparing for it. I love this man with everything I have in me. He is a unicorn in this world, and he will be back stronger and better than ever before," Claire <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTeozdbDhbS/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>captioned an Instagram post</u></a> showing her and the 49ers star in the training room and on the sidelines at Lincoln Financial Field.</p><p>"The mind of a heartbroken athlete is a determined one. He is un-(expletive)-able, as is this entire team. I’m proud of these guys and the rally-together grit they fight with each week. It’s a special year, you can feel that and we’re not done yet. Thank you for loving G and carrying some of this pain for us," she wrote.</p><p>Kittle responded to his wife’s post with his own message of gratitude, commenting, "You’re the best teammate for this journey."</p><p>Kittle dealt with injuries during the regular season, which limited him to 11 games. He still recorded 628 receiving yards and hauled in seven touchdowns.</p><p>The Niners will face their division rivals, the Seattle Seahawks, on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a></p>
