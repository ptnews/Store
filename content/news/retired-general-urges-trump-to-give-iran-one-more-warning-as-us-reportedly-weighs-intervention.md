<p>Retired Gen. Jack Keane called on the Trump administration to confront <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran’s leadership</a> head-on, urging a final warning before taking action against officials he says are responsible for violently cracking down on protesters.</p><p>"The president has told them, ‘If you kill them, I’m coming for you,’" Keane said during an appearance on "Life, Liberty &amp; Levin" on Saturday.</p><p>"They’ve already killed more than 40 people, and they’ve jailed many more. And in jail, they will execute them."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/armed-iran-protesters-battle-police-tehran-streets-trump-warns-forceful-us-response" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>nationwide anti-regime demonstrations</u></a> across Iran hit the two-week mark, Keane argued that President Donald Trump should now follow through by issuing one last warning before targeting those responsible for maintaining an iron grip on the population.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-flips-kill-switch-hide-alleged-crimes-death-toll-rises-amid-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN FLIPS ‘KILL SWITCH’ TO HIDE ALLEGED CRIMES AS DEATH TOLL RISES AMID PROTESTS</strong></a></p><p>"I think the president could give one more warning and then <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take down some of the leaders</a> responsible for conducting violence against the Iranian population," Keane said. </p><p>"I believe that we have the leverage here to actually curtail this behavior."</p><p>This comes as multiple Israeli sources told Reuters that the Trump administration is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-rubio-discuss-us-military-intervention-iran-amid-ongoing-nationwide-protests-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighing possible U.S. military intervention</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-protests-prompt-new-trump-warning-over-deadly-government-crackdowns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN PROTESTS PROMPT NEW TRUMP WARNING OVER DEADLY GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWNS</strong></a></p><p>Fox News Digital previously reached out to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>State Department</u></a> and White House for comment.</p><p>Trump voiced support for the protesters in a Truth Social post on Saturday, writing, "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!"</p><p>The president also said at a Friday news conference that the U.S. would respond forcefully if the regime resorts to mass violence.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-regime-said-unleash-hezbollah-iraqi-militias-uprising-spreads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN REGIME SAID TO UNLEASH HEZBOLLAH AND IRAQI MILITIAS AS UPRISING SPREADS</strong></a></p><p>"We’ll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn’t mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts," he said.</p><p>Keane noted Trump's outspokenness on behalf of the Iranian people, calling him the first president to voice explicit support for protesters.</p><p>"This president has done that, and I think he will likely have to follow through on it," he added.</p><p>During a Sunday appearance on "Fox &amp; Friends Weekend," retired Navy Vice Adm. Robert Harward called Iranian regime change "inevitable."</p><p>"This president does what he says. He's made that very clear in Venezuela and other places, so it's going to happen," he said.</p><p>"We stand behind the people of Iran. And don't forget what Iran was in the '70s: a prosperous nation that enjoyed all the values and support of the West, so I believe this is four or five decades in the coming — It will happen."</p><p><i>Fox News' Michael Sinkewicz contributed to this report.</i></p>
