"I hate to waste a lot of time on this, but if you’re going to write a bad story about my health, I’m going to sue the a-- off of New York Magazine. There will be a time when you can write that story, maybe in two years, three years, five years — five years, no one is going to care, I guess. Go ahead and sit down."</p><p>The article noted recent headlines about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-explains-bruise-trumps-hand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president's bruised hand,</a> as well as other speculation surrounding Trump's fitness.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-inside-trumps-private-schedule-media-fixates-his-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>EXCLUSIVE: INSIDE TRUMP’S PRIVATE SCHEDULE AS MEDIA FIXATES ON HIS HEALTH</u></strong></a></p><p>The article quoted multiple administration officials, as well as Eric Trump, praising the president's health.</p><p>"When he signed the Epstein transparency bill, he was here until I think 9:50, 9:45," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> communications director Steven Cheung told Terris. "And the next day, he was here till 9:30. As much as I hate to admit it, I’m exhausted going into the workday and I’m exhausted at the end of the workday trying to keep up with the president."</p><p>Terris also quoted Trump asking the doctors in the room about his health.</p><p>"Real fast," Trump said, speaking to the doctors present for the interview, according to the article.
