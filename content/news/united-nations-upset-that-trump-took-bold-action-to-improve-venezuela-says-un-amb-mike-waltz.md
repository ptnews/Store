<p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/hannity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Hannity"</a> on Tuesday why he believes the UN is "so upset" about President Donald Trump's capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>"Over 50 countries didn't even recognize Maduro because he stole the election. So, it's hard to figure out what they’re so upset about," Waltz told Fox News host Sean Hannity.</p><p>"I think we know the answer. It's because it's President Trump, and he's a man of action and took real action. And now the Venezuelan people are going to be better off," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-maduro-takedown-resets-global-chessboard-reasserts-american-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP'S MADURO TAKEDOWN RESETS THE GLOBAL CHESSBOARD AND REASSERTS AMERICAN POWER</strong></a></p><p>Waltz’s comments came after the UN said Tuesday the United States’ removal of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venezuela’s Maduro</a> violates international law and makes the world less safe.</p><p>Maduro is currently being held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. — a facility notorious for housing high-profile criminals like disgraced musician Sean "Diddy" Combs and Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>He pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges, including narco-terrorism.</p><p>Waltz applauded the president for taking "real action" against the South American strongman.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-embraces-us-interventionism-venezuela-he-sets-sights-cuba-colombia-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP EMBRACES US INTERVENTION IN VENEZUELA, OPENS DOOR TO BROADER LATIN AMERICA PUSH</strong></a></p><p>"The world is safer, stronger and certainly more prosperous because of it," Waltz argued.</p><p>China, Russia and Iran are among several nations that have criticized the administration’s actions against the dictator.</p><p>But, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump-appointed</a> ambassador maintained dethroning Maduro was a good choice from the commander-in-chief.</p><p>"This was the right thing to do," said Waltz. "President Trump took bold action and will continue to swing and DOGE that ridiculous organization called the United Nations."</p><p>Waltz also touted defunding the UN's Human Rights Council, a move he said was made possible by the Trump administration.</p><p>"We just pushed and pressed the UN to agree to cut over 3,000 of its bureaucrats, its first budget cut in its history. So we're DOGE-ing away," he said.</p>
