<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/sam-darnold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Darnold</a>’s journey to a Super Bowl has been a long and winding one.</p><p>Darnold was the No. 3 overall pick of the 2018 NFL Draft out of USC by the New York Jets. He was the second quarterback taken behind Baker Mayfield and was a part of an epic rookie class at the quarterback position. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/josh-allen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Josh Allen</a>, Josh Rosen and Lamar Jackson were also taken in the first round.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Mason Rudolph, Mike White and Luke Falk were also quarterbacks from that draft class that earned starts during their careers.</p><p>If anyone took a peek at Darnold’s career through his first eight years, it reads more like a journeyman quarterback rather than one that a franchise was about to bet on. He played three seasons with the Jets before the franchise grew impatient and traded him away.</p><p>From there, Darnold was on the Carolina Panthers, San Francisco 49ers and Minnesota Vikings. He took the Vikings to the playoffs after a career year and only built up on it when he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/seattle-seahawks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a three-year deal with Seattle</a> to replace Geno Smith.</p><p>Darnold had 4,048 passing yards and 25 passing touchdowns as Seattle went 14-3 and earned the top seed in the NFL playoffs.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/super-bowl-lx-what-know-about-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SUPER BOWL LX: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GAME</strong></a></p><p>Now, he’s the first quarterback from his draft class to earn a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/super-bowl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Bowl appearance</a>.</p><p>"You can’t talk about the game without talking about our quarterback," Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said. "He shut a lot of people up tonight, so I’m happy for him."</p><p>Darnold played through an oblique injury and was 25-of-36 for 346 yards without a turnover.</p><p>"Can’t say enough about Sam, man," Seahawks star Jaxson Smith-Njigba said. "It’s been a great first year. We got one more to go. But for him to overcome what he had to overcome, I’m riding with Sam all day."</p><p>Now, the Seahawks will play in Super Bowl LX against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New England Patriots</a>.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
