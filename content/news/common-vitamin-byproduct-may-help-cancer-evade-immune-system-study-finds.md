<p>A substance the body makes from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vitamins-supplements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vitamin A</a> can make the immune system less effective at fighting cancer, a new study reveals.</p><p>Vitamin A itself is an essential nutrient, but one of its byproducts can accidentally "turn off" parts of the immune response against cancer, according to new research published in Nature Immunology.</p><p>Blocking that byproduct’s effects can restore immune activity and may improve cancer immunotherapy, the findings suggest.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/fast-growing-cancer-could-slowed-common-blood-pressure-drug-research-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FAST-GROWING CANCER COULD BE SLOWED BY COMMON BLOOD PRESSURE DRUG, RESEARCH SHOWS</strong></a></p><p>Researchers at the Princeton University Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made this discovery</a> by growing dendritic cells, key immune cells that activate the body’s defenses, in a lab. </p><p>As these cells developed, the scientists noticed they naturally turned on an enzyme that makes retinoic acid, a molecule that comes from vitamin A.</p><p>Retinoic acid can weaken dendritic cells' ability to stimulate immune responses. This reduces the effectiveness of dendritic cell vaccines, an immunotherapy that trains the immune system to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/cancer-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack cancer</a>, according to the study.</p><p>The researchers also found that when dendritic cells made a lot of the retinoic acid, they were less able to send strong danger signals to the immune system.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>When they removed the retinoic acid, the dendritic cells became stronger and better at activating T cells, which are the immune system’s cancer-killing cells.</p><p>A second study, published in iScience by collaborators from the same research group, looked at how to develop drugs to block this process.</p><p>Using <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/medical-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computer modeling</a> and large drug screens, the team designed and identified small molecules that blocked the enzymes that produce retinoic acid. </p><p>This led to the creation of a promising inhibitor that shuts down retinoic acid production in a controlled way, the same tool used in the first study’s experiments, the researchers noted.</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Taken together, our findings reveal the broad influence retinoic acid has in attenuating vitally important <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immune responses to cancer</a>," lead researcher Yibin Kang said in a press release.</p><p>"In exploring this phenomenon, we also solved a long-standing challenge in pharmacology by developing safe and selective <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inhibitors of retinoic acid</a> signaling and established preclinical proof of concept for their use in cancer immunotherapy."</p><p>As these findings are based on laboratory and animal models, they may not fully reflect how retinoic acid functions in humans.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>Also, the studies examined a specific vitamin A-derived molecule (retinoic acid) acting in immune cells, not dietary vitamin A intake or overall vitamin A status.</p><p>Vitamin A remains an essential nutrient for normal immune function, growth and vision, according to the National Institutes of Health, and extensive human studies have found no evidence that vitamin A causes cancer.</p>
