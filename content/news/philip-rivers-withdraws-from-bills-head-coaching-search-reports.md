<p>NFL great <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/philip-rivers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philip Rivers</a> reportedly removed himself as a candidate for the Buffalo Bills head-coaching job despite earning high marks for his interview.</p><p>Rivers dropped out on Monday morning, according to multiple reports. He had been one of the handful of people considered for the job to replace Sean McDermott. The Bills fired McDermott last week following a heartbreaking loss in the playoffs to the Denver Broncos.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>The former quarterback interviewed for the job after playing for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/indianapolis-colts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indianapolis Colts</a> this season. He came off the sideline as the head coach for a high school team and was thrust into the starting role once Daniel Jones tore his Achilles and was lost for the rest of the season.</p><p>Rivers never won a game with the Colts and, ultimately, Indianapolis’ chances of making the playoffs were sunk. By playing in the league this season, Rivers also reset his Hall of Fame clock even as he was likely on the verge of making it to Canton this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/super-bowl-lx-what-know-about-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SUPER BOWL LX: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GAME</strong></a></p><p>It appeared that Rivers was a viable option as head coach in the Bills brass’ minds.</p><p>"One of the biggest stories of the year was Philip Rivers coming back to the field, unbelievable, and actually it is not done yet," <a href="https://x.com/RapSheet/status/2015437334490103835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport</a> said on "NFL Gameday Morning."</p><p>"Philip Rivers interviewed in the last several days for the Buffalo Bills head coaching job, in person.
