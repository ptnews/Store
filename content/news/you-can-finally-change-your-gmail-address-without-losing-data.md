<p>For years, one of the most frustrating limits inside the Google ecosystem was simple but painful. You could not change your <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary Gmail address</a> without creating a brand-new account. That meant losing history, purchases and years of saved data. That is now changing.</p><p>Google has started rolling out a feature that lets people replace their existing @gmail.com address with a new one. Even better, everything tied to the account stays exactly where it is.</p><p>Given that Gmail has close to 2 billion active accounts, this update affects almost everyone. It also helps people who stopped using an old Gmail address tied to a past job, a move or a major life change.</p><p><strong>Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report</strong></p><p>Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

Some picked usernames that no longer feel professional. Others tie an address to a relationship, employer or location that no longer applies.</p><p>Until now, Google treated Gmail usernames as permanent. The only workaround involved creating a new account and manually rebuilding everything. This update removes that burden. You can refresh your digital identity without starting over.</p><p>If your account ends in @gmail.com, you may now be able to replace it with a brand-new @gmail.com address.</p><p>Here is what stays the same:</p><p>Your old email address does not disappear. Google automatically converts it into an alias. That means messages sent to both addresses arrive in the same inbox. You can also sign in using either email.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/new-gmail-tool-makes-easy-unsubscribe-from-emails-bulk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW GMAIL TOOL MAKES IT EASY TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM EMAILS IN BULK</strong></a></p><p>Google added limits to prevent abuse and confusion. Once you change your Gmail address, you cannot create another new Gmail address on that same account for 12 months. You can switch back to your original address at any time.</p><p>There are also a few areas where friction may occur. If you use Sign in with Google on third-party websites, you may need to sign in again. Chromebook users and Chrome Remote Desktop users may need to re-authenticate. Before making the switch, Google recommends backing up critical data and reviewing connected apps.</p><p>Google is rolling this feature out gradually, so it may not appear on every account yet.</p><p>Google may test different layouts, so wording can vary slightly by account</p><p>To check your account:</p><p>If you see the option, you can check availability and choose a new Gmail username. If the option does not appear, the feature has likely not yet reached your account. Accounts managed by schools, workplaces or organizations usually require administrator approval.</p><p>An alias is an additional email address that delivers messages to the same inbox. With this update, your old Gmail address becomes an alias automatically. Aliases are useful beyond Gmail. They help you keep access to old contacts while presenting a cleaner primary address going forward. They also reduce disruption when changing emails across services. If you want to change your email address on other platforms, aliases are often the safest option.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/cybersecurity-expert-reveals-simple-trick-stop-companies-tracking-your-online-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CYBERSECURITY EXPERT REVEALS SIMPLE TRICK TO STOP COMPANIES FROM TRACKING YOUR ONLINE SHOPPING</strong></a></p><p>Outlook.com allows you to create additional email addresses (aliases) that are linked to your primary account. Emails sent to an alias will arrive in your primary inbox, and you can send messages using the alias as well.</p><p>If your primary email is johnsmith@outlook.com, you can create an alias like john.smith123@outlook.com. Emails sent to john.smith123@outlook.com will still go to johnsmith@outlook.com, but you can choose to send emails using either address.</p><p><strong>Steps to create an alias:</strong></p><p>Once added, you can send emails using your alias by selecting it in the <strong>"From"</strong> field when composing a new message.</p><p><strong>Important limitations to note:</strong></p><p>Apple allows you to create up to three email aliases through iCloud. These aliases can be used for specific purposes, helping you manage your inbox effectively. Here’s how to create one:</p><p>It's important to note that you can still create up to three email aliases through iCloud. Remember that while these aliases provide some flexibility, they do not create separate Apple IDs or completely hide your primary iCloud email address.</p><p>Hide My Email is a feature available with iCloud+ that allows you to create unique, random email addresses that are forwarded to your personal email account. This helps keep your real email address private when filling out forms, signing up for newsletters or sending emails. Here's how to set up Hide My Email:</p><p>You can also generate Hide My Email addresses directly in Safari, Mail and supported third-party apps by tapping the email address field and selecting <strong>Hide My Email</strong> above the keyboard.</p><p>Note that Hide My Email has limitations. You need an iCloud+ subscription to use Hide My Email. This feature is not available with the free iCloud plan. While there is no official limit on the number of aliases you can create, some people have reported creating hundreds of addresses without issue. Hide My Email works with iCloud+, Apple Pay and the Mail app. Support for other apps and services is expanding but may not be available for all. Some people have reported occasional issues with email deliverability when using Hide My Email addresses. Managing multiple aliases can become cumbersome, especially if you need to deactivate or update them frequently. </p><p>For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit<strong> </strong><i><strong>Cyberguy.com</strong></i></p><p><strong>Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?</strong></p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected?
