I don’t think they’re doing the Democratic Party any favors," <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/26/us-news/dems-should-tell-celebrities-to-just-shut-the-f-k-up-bill-maher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he told the outlet</a>. "I think if Democrats want to win elections in the future, job one, tell the celebrities to ‘Just shut the f--- up. You’re not helping. You don’t strike people in most of the country as sensible or in touch with reality.'"</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-calls-mamdani-straight-up-communist-warns-dems-lose-more-elections-deny" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BILL MAHER CALLS MAMDANI A 'STRAIGHT UP COMMUNIST,' WARNS DEMS WILL 'LOSE MORE ELECTIONS' IF THEY DENY IT</strong></a></p><p>Maher, a self-described liberal who frequently criticizes both the left and the right, has faced backlash from some progressives for his critiques of woke ideology and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/democratic-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Party</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, fellow comedian <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/wanda-sykes-rips-kimmel-suspension-calls-riyadh-comedy-fest-saudi-arabia-anti-comedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wanda Sykes</a> took a swipe at the "Real Time" host while presenting the award for Best Stand-Up Comedy Performance at the Golden Globes, for which Maher was nominated for his HBO special "Is Anyone Else Seeing This?"</p><p>In the special, Maher referred to colleges as "four-year daycare [centers] for the crybullies of the privileged" and said, "You wonder why the left catches more jokes from me? They changed, not me, OK?"</p><p>"Bill Maher, you give us so much," Sykes said while presenting the award.

Gervais' comedy had previously been deemed "anti-trans" by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD).</p><p>As noted by the Post, Maher had previously predicted on his "Club Random" podcast that he wouldn't win because of his willingness to call out both sides of the aisle: "I speak freely, and this woke town f---ing hates that. And that’s okay. I’ve made my peace with that." </p><p>Aside from Maher's special not winning, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-rogan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Rogan</a>'s top-rated podcast "The Joe Rogan Experience" was notably left off the Globe's nominations for its new podcast category.</p><p>"It was typical and predictable and also ridiculous that Joe Rogan wouldn’t be nominated in a category that he dominates," Maher told the California Post.</p><p>"Good Hang with Amy Poehler," which was ranked lower than Rogan's podcast on the Spotify, Apple and YouTube Podcasts charts, ended up winning the Globe's inaugural Best Podcast category.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE</u></strong></a></p><p>During a conversation with comedians Dana Carvey and David Spade on "Club Random" last week, Maher blasted the Globes as "f---ing smug a--holes," and said the nominees were all "super woke stuff."</p><p>"Did you see that there’s a podcast category at the Globes?" Maher asked. "They only nominated like the super woke stuff."</p><p>"I’m sure there were good shows, but it was glaring that Joe Rogan was not nominated," he added. "I mean, it is kind of popular."</p>
