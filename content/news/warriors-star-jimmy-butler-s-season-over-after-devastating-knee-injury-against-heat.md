He had been playing well with the Warriors through 37 games this season, averaging 20.1 points, 5.6 rebounds and 4.9 assists.</p><p>The Warriors may need to make some moves if they want to push toward another NBA title. They are 25-19 after the win Monday night and are eighth in the Western Conference.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s </strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to </strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
