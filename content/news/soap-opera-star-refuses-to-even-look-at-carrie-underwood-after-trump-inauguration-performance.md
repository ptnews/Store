<p>"General Hospital" star Nancy Lee Grahn claimed that she can no longer look at "American Idol" icon <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/carrie-underwood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carrie Underwood</a> after the latter performed at President Donald Trump's inauguration last year.</p><p><a href="https://www.threads.com/@nancyleegrahn/post/DT12paeFTPY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Grahn took to Threads</a> on Thursday after Underwood joined her fellow "American Idol" judges Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie to promote the upcoming season of the reality singing show on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"</p><p>"See ya next week @jimmykimmel. I refuse to even look at @carrieunderwood," Grahn wrote.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/american-idol-producer-says-its-great-carrie-underwood-performed-trump-inauguration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'AMERICAN IDOL' PRODUCER SAYS IT'S 'GREAT' CARRIE UNDERWOOD PERFORMED AT TRUMP INAUGURATION</strong></a></p><p>Though Grahn did not specify why she would "refuse to even look" at Underwood in the original post, several commenters, including anti-Trump comedian Kathy Griffin, suggested that Underwood was too "MAGA" for liberal fans.</p><p>"I’ll watch ya! Yeah, no love for maga Carrie. It’s not just about political disagreements anymore," <a href="https://www.threads.com/@kathygriffin/post/DT145zujizl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Griffin commented</a>.</p><p>After the post began going viral, Grahn wrote another post clarifying that she was not attacking Kimmel in her comment and reiterated her anger toward Underwood "for obvious reasons."</p><p>"Truth matters. I LOVE Jimmy Kimmel &amp; watch him every night. I would never 'slam' him. I simply said I would watch him next week because I didn’t want to look at Carrie Underwood (for obvious reasons) who was his guest that night. Come on guys, I’m not worth the silly clickbait," <a href="https://www.threads.com/@nancyleegrahn/post/DT5qaMjidRz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Grahn wrote</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-view-co-host-says-joy-behar-calling-carrie-underwood-un-american-selfish-publicity-gain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FORMER 'VIEW' CO-HOST SAYS JOY BEHAR CALLING CARRIE UNDERWOOD 'UN-AMERICAN' IS 'SELFISH PUBLICITY GAIN'</strong></a></p><p>Last month, Grahn also accused Underwood of being "MAGA" while posting a video of former CNN host Don Lemon reacting to Underwood mocking the Affordable Care Act website at the 2013 Country Music Awards.</p><p>"I thought everyone knew Carrie Underwood was MAGA. She’s American all right, but certainly no Idol," <a href="https://www.threads.com/@nancyleegrahn/post/DSvhx9miR0s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Grahn wrote</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital</a> reached out to Underwood's representative for comment.</p><p>Underwood previously faced <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-behar-questions-how-carrie-underwood-could-love-country-shes-performing-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backlash from liberal critics</a> after agreeing to perform "America the Beautiful" at Trump's second inauguration in 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carrie-underwood-says-its-difficult-bring-faith-entertainment-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>‘AMERICAN IDOL’ JUDGE CARRIE UNDERWOOD ADMITS IT’S 'DIFFICULT' TO BRING FAITH INTO HOLLYWOOD</strong></a></p><p>Despite being largely apolitical in the public sphere, Underwood said in a statement that she was "honored" to have been invited to perform.</p><p>"I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event," Underwood said. "I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future."</p><p>Her performance later received <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carrie-underwood-triumphs-trump-inauguration-after-musical-mishap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread praise</a> on social media after a technical difficulty forced Underwood to perform the song a capella.</p>
