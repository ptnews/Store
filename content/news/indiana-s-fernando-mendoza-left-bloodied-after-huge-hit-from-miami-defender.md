<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/indiana-hoosiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Hoosiers</a> star quarterback Fernando Mendoza was on the receiving end of a huge hit in the first quarter of the national championship game against the Miami Hurricanes on Monday.</p><p>Mendoza handed the ball off to his running back and went up to Miami defenders, pretending to block. However, Mendoza bit off a bit more than he could chew.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/miami-hurricanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hurricanes defensive back</a> Jakobe Thomas met Mendoza and knocked the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback backward. Mendoza fell and the ESPN broadcast showed him bleeding from the lip.</p><p>College football fans were wondering whether Thomas avoided a targeting penalty on the play. It appeared Thomas hit Mendoza with the crown of his helmet. The officiating crew on the field didn’t catch it and the drive continued.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-arrives-indiana-miami-college-football-national-championship" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TRUMP ARRIVES AT INDIANA-MIAMI COLLEGE FOOTBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP</strong></a></p><p>Mendoza is accustomed to taking some big hits. He took a huge hit earlier in the season <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/iowa-hawkeyes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">against Iowa</a> and was leveled on the first play of the game against Ohio State. He stayed in the game both times and the Hoosiers won.</p><p>Indiana’s scoring began later in the first quarter with a field goal. Then, with about 6:13 left in the second quarter, Mendoza led the Hoosiers down the field and handed the ball off to Riley Nowakowski to punch the ball in. The Hoosiers held a 10-0 lead at that point.</p><p>If the score holds, Indiana will be celebrating its first college football national championship.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
