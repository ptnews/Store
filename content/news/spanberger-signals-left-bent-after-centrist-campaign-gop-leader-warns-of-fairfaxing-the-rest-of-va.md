<p>Newly minted Virginia Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/abigail-spanberger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abigail Spanberger</a> campaigned as a pragmatic centrist, while critics said her day-one actions depict a very different four years the Old Dominion is about to experience.</p><p>In a flurry of executive orders after her inauguration, the Democrat rescinded ex-Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 287(g) order that instituted cooperation with ICE, and seized on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/im-new-virginia-governor-affordability-what-everyone-needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broad affordability initiatives including housing</a> regulation reviews that align with progressive approaches to zoning.</p><p>Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Cumberland Gap, saw his razor-thin 2025 minority get slashed to 36-64 after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/inside-jay-jones-democrats-late-surge-upset-wins-across-virginia-from-suburbs-shore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November’s wave election that Spanberger</a> also won.</p><p>When asked about one of Spanberger’s key executive orders, establishing a "process for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">housing affordability</a>," and how critics warned what that may mean for intervention in local zoning matters, Kilgore said that when it comes down to it, "government’s not always the answer."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-how-spanberger-won-virginia-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FOX NEWS POLL: HOW SPANBERGER WON VIRGINIA GOVERNOR</strong></a></p><p>"What you have to do is allow the free market to go in and build the houses and get a rate of return. But a lot of bills that we're passing here now; a landlord-tenant [bill] would keep folks if they're not paying their rent [have] longer to come up with their rent, gives them all kinds of options there," Kilgore said.</p><p>"When folks are investing money and they are losing money because they can't get folks out because they're not paying their rent, they're not going to invest in the Commonwealth."</p><p>He criticized how Spanberger’s orders often created commissions or panels, remarking, "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/spanberger-takes-swipe-trump-admin-says-virginians-worried-about-recklessness-coming-out-washington" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia needs affordability now</a>; that’s what was campaigned on."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/spanberger-says-absolutely-not-using-election-wins-justify-government-shutdown-stance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SPANBERGER SAYS 'ABSOLUTELY NOT' TO USING ELECTION WINS TO JUSTIFY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN STANCE</strong></a></p><p>"We're willing as a Republican caucus to [step] up right now. There are things we can do to make Virginia more affordable... We don't need a study. Let's work on it right now and address what we can."</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Spanberger for comment on whether her executive order would potentially lead to overriding local zoning policies – and for more clarity on her definition of "affordable" in terms of housing, and on her 287(g) rescission.</p><p>Spanberger’s order said she would "support, encourage, coordinate, and innovate using the fullest powers of state government in partnership with local governments and the nonprofit and private sectors to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/spanberger-says-virginia-chose-pragmatism-over-partisanship-victory-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create practical solutions that meet</a> the housing needs of Virginians."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/showdown-house-democrats-republicans-brace-high-stakes-midterm-clash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SHOWDOWN FOR THE HOUSE: DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS BRACE FOR HIGH-STAKES MIDTERM CLASH</strong></a></p><p>Del. Wren Williams, R-Stuart, told Fox News Digital that the flurry of orders, including the housing affordability one, is "exactly what we said would happen."</p><p>"Governor Spanberger campaigned as a centrist pragmatist, but she was a progressive in moderate’s clothing from the start."</p><p>"Her ‘affordable housing’ order raises serious questions about whether this administration will override local zoning authority across the Commonwealth. Virginians were sold a facade of practical solutions to make the Commonwealth affordable—instead, they’re getting <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/zohran-mamdani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a>-style collectivism dressed up as housing policy."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/full-blown-battle-brewing-dem-party-mamdani-style-candidates-rise-key-races" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>'FULL-BLOWN BATTLE' BREWING IN DEM PARTY AS MAMDANI-STYLE CANDIDATES RISE IN KEY RACES</strong></a></p><p>Another top concern for Virginia Republicans is a push by Spanberger and Senate Leader L. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, to redraw the state’s congressional map in a way that would leave only one GOP-held seat — represented by Rep. Morgan Griffith — in an otherwise purple state.</p><p>"The Democrats are pursuing redrawing our lines in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Commonwealth of Virginia</a> to basically ‘Fairfax’ the rest of Virginia. That's what I'm calling it because all the lines that are being drawn across the Commonwealth to make it a 10-1 Democrat majority in Virginia."</p><p>He said the lines proposed by Democrats don’t connect "communities-of-interest," remarking that Washington suburbs have little in common with the Shenandoah Valley and so forth.</p><p>"[Democrats] say it's because there's a threat to democracy. I don't know what the threat to democracy is or who's threatening anybody over democracy. So it's just a power grab," he quipped.</p><p>Republicans also suggested the leftward pivot is two-front, as Kilgore’s office shared a slew of what they dubbed the "bad bills" that the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/legislation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new legislature</a> has already crafted for Spanberger.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-slammed-truly-demonic-election-excused-political-violence-spite-trump-critics-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VIRGINIA SLAMMED FOR ‘TRULY DEMONIC’ ELECTION THAT EXCUSED POLITICAL VIOLENCE TO SPITE TRUMP, CRITICS SAY</strong></a></p><p>Several create new sales taxes, including 4.3% on Amazon and food-delivery services, 3.8% additional investment tax on top of the state income tax, which critics said would unnecessarily harm low-and-mid-tier investors, and a ban on gas-powered leaf blowers.</p><p>Another so-called "bad bill" would extend the absentee ballot acceptance period, prohibit hand-counting of ballots, allow internet-based voting, lower robbery penalties, and enact several Second Amendment-related taxes.</p><p>Kilgore said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/abigail-spanberger-seals-historic-virginia-win-ending-gops-glenn-youngkin-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">housing affordability also includes energy</a><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> costs</a>, adding Spanberger indicated she would reenter Virginia into RGGI, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. He noted another Democrat-led energy-industry state – Pennsylvania – just took itself out of the pact.</p><p>However, Kilgore also agreed with observers who warn that Spanberger and Richmond Democrats’ swift pivot from the Youngkin years may lead to voter backlash in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/midterm-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the midterms</a>.</p><p>Sen. Mark Warner, a former Democratic governor himself, is up for reelection, as are every congressman, delegate and state senator.</p><p>"Virginia is not a liberal state. A lot of folks think, ‘Oh, [Democrats] got their trifecta now’, but … we're a moderate state," Kilgore said.</p><p>"We are already looking at these bills – the pendulum swings back. I've been in politics a long time, and I've seen the pendulum go back and forth in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and I'm sure that we'll be back."</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Kiera McDonald contributed to this report</i>.</p>
