<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carson Beck</a> is one win away from being a college national champion, and he didn't even have to juggle classes to get this far.</p><p>Beck has led the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/miami-hurricanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami Hurricanes</a> all the way to the College Football Playoff title game after transferring to the South Florida school. Beck, by his own admission, has not had many distractions off the field.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong> </strong></i></p><p>When asked if he attended class earlier in the week ahead of Monday night's title game, he laughed off the question.</p><p>"No class. I graduated two years ago," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkZB3oEnzhk&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.on3.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Beck said</a>.</p><p>Beck, who attended Georgia before transferring, added that he is "working toward other degrees now that I’ve gotten to Miami, but these programs take a little longer than just a year to finish."</p><p>"Obviously, I'm not enrolling again next semester. I'll be done after this season," Beck continued.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/governors-braun-desantis-place-friendly-wager-national-championship-between-miami-indiana" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GOVERNORS BRAUN, DESANTIS PLACE 'FRIENDLY WAGER' FOR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP BETWEEN MIAMI AND INDIANA</strong></a></p><p>That response turned heads on social media.</p><p>"College football is dead," <a href="https://x.com/NickyPerkss/status/2012695149852205180" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote one user</a>.</p><p>"Bro turned ‘College Athlete’ into a full time career," <a href="https://x.com/RatioedSports/status/2012700507094007936" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added another</a>.</p><p>"Playing college football but not attending class for two years is crazy," <a href="https://x.com/CollegeSportsCo/status/2012709434665947648" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said one more</a>.</p><p>Beck doubled down on his commitment to the football program.</p><p>"I live in the facility. That’s about it. If I’m not at the facility, I’m at home, and I just kind of bounce back and forth. It’s been that way for about the past month," Beck added.</p><p>Beck's touchdown with 18 seconds left last week propelled the 10th-seeded Hurricanes to a 31-27 win over No. 6 Ole Miss.
