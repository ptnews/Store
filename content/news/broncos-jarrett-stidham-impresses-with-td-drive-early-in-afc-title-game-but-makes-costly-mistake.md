<p>Denver Broncos quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jarrett-stidham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jarrett Stidham</a> was the team’s only shot of getting to the Super Bowl on Sunday against the New England Patriots, and he showed he wasn’t going to back down from the challenge.</p><p>The journeyman quarterback had a dud of a first drive. However, on the second, he really set the stage for what the Patriots will have to deal with.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Stidham and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Broncos</a> faced a third down once again early in the game. But Stidham found wide receiver Marvin Mims flying past Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez. Stidham threw a perfect pass to the wide receiver and got Denver into the red zone.</p><p>The 52-yard play set up the Broncos’ score two plays later. Stidham found <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/courtland-sutton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Courtland Sutton</a> for a 6-yard touchdown pass to give the Broncos the lead early in the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/broncos-quarterbacks-wives-share-emotional-social-media-posts-after-bo-nixs-injury-causes-major-shakeup" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BRONCOS QUARTERBACKS' WIVES SHARE EMOTIONAL SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AFTER BO NIX'S INJURY CAUSES MAJOR SHAKEUP</strong></a></p><p>The drive impressed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL fans</a> who were following the game on social media.</p><p>But the honeymoon would only last a few more minutes before a crucial mistake led to a Patriots score. With 2:58 left in the first half, Stidham’s hasty throw to get the ball out of his hands instead of taking a sack was ruled to be a backward pass.</p><p>The Patriots recovered the ball and, two plays later, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/drake-maye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drake Maye</a> ran the ball into the end zone from 6 yards out and help tie the game with just over two minutes left to play.</p><p>He guided the Broncos down the field before halftime, but Will Lutz missed a go-ahead field goal with 20 seconds to go.</p><p>Denver and New England were tied at 7-7.</p><p>Stidham was 12-of-21 with 123 passing yards, a touchdown pass and three sacks.</p><p>Stidham was making his first start of the 2025 season and the first start of his career in the playoffs. He was a fourth-round pick of the New England Patriots in 2019 and spent one season as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tom-brady" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Brady</a>’s backup before he moved on to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p>He was with the Patriots until the 2022 season, when the Patriots traded him to the Las Vegas Raiders. He then signed with the Broncos in 2023.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong> <u>sports coverage on X,</u></strong></i></a><i><strong> and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
