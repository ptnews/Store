<p>A new bill proposed by Democrats in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia state legislature</a> is raising concerns regarding the removal of minimum prison sentences for various violent felony crimes. </p><p>Within days of Democratic Gov. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/abigail-spanberger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abigail Spanberger</a> being sworn in, members of her party introduced a flurry of amendments looking to end mandatory minimum sentences for various crimes within the state. </p><p>According to Jason Miyares, the former Republican attorney general, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/legislation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Bill 863</a> includes proposals to effectively eliminate minimum sentencing for manslaughter, rape, possession and distribution of child pornography, assaulting a law enforcement officer and other repeat violent felonies. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservatives-rip-virginia-governors-moderate-label-after-radical-laundry-list-day-1-moves" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CONSERVATIVES RIP VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S ‘MODERATE’ LABEL AFTER RADICAL LAUNDRY LIST OF DAY 1 MOVES</strong></a></p><p>Additionally, Democrats are also looking to remove the mandatory five-day minimum sentence for certain first-time DUI offenders.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/legislation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HB 863</a> is a common-sense proposal that eliminates the requirement for one-size-fits-all minimum sentences for certain crimes," Delegate Rae Cousins, who sponsored the bill, said, <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-state-legislature-richmond-mandatory-minimum-sentences-offense-dui-felony-assault-intellection-disability-mental-illness-accountability-jail-prison-crime-safety-driving-drinking-commonwealth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>according to</u></a> ABC 7. </p><p>"This change would give the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced judges</a> in our communities more discretion to make decisions based on the unique facts of each case. As the General Assembly session continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation and promote fairer outcomes in our justice system."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-rips-dem-run-county-after-illegal-immigrant-murderer-released-blood-hands" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>DHS RIPS DEM-RUN COUNTY AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT MURDERER RELEASED: 'BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS'</strong></a></p><p>However, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law enforcement experts</a> are pushing back against the bill while expressing concerns about how the possibility of more lenient sentencing could impact victims of violent crimes.</p><p>"From a law enforcement standpoint, I think police generally want offenders to be held accountable, and frustration among law enforcement officers grows when individuals are released quickly and subsequently re-offend – and even more so if it involved a violent felony," law enforcement expert Josh Ederheimer told Fox News Digital. I think that also tracks the thinking of many members of the public.  I think there is more tolerance for flexibility for minor offenses. </p><p>Ederheimer, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia's Center for Public Safety and Justice and a retired law enforcement officer, went on to explain that police typically understand unique circumstances that can point to a defendant receiving a lesser sentence, but frustration still exists surrounding more serious crimes.</p><p>"For violent felonies, however, the biggest practical concern is that the defendant will re-offend, and that the public is not alerted or aware that the defendant has returned to the community. It’s an accountability concern that falls on the shoulders of judges and prosecutors."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jay-jones-two-bullets-scandal-over-violent-texts-expected-dominate-virginia-ag-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JAY JONES’ ‘TWO BULLETS’ SCANDAL OVER VIOLENT TEXTS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE VIRGINIA AG DEBATE</strong></a></p><p>The proposed bill would allow courts to hand down sentences based on the individual facts of each case, rather than <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statutory mandates</a> implemented by the state’s government. However, it does not impact maximum penalties in such cases. </p><p>Ederheimer further explained that the bill could have a negative impact on victims and their families regarding accountability for violent offenders. </p><p>"I think that the police and public alike have expectations that convicted criminals will be held accountable, and that full sentences should be served," Ederheimer said. "Mandatory minimums assure victims – and the community – that a convicted person will serve their sentence."  </p><p>"It is the circumstance when convicted felons are released early that victims may feel a sense of betrayal or that justice was not served. That’s the dilemma."</p><p>The bill is set to be reviewed by the House and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/hearings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Justice Committees</a>, where it will likely be amended.</p><p>However, Ederheimer added that mandatory minimum sentences may not actually encourage violent offenders not to commit crimes, further adding to the complex balance of maintaining justice and community safety. </p><p>"From a law enforcement perspective, I don’t think mandatory minimums serve as a deterrent," Ederheimer told Fox News Digital. "I think that largely defendants are not focused on repercussions at the time of their offense."</p>
