<p>As someone who grew up with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/miami-hurricanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami Hurricanes</a> star running back Mark Fletcher Jr., Indiana cornerback D'Angelo Ponds was surprised to see him in an altercation with his Hoosiers teammate. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/indiana-hoosiers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hoosiers</a> made history Monday night, defeating the Hurricanes to complete the first-ever 16-0 season in college football. It was Jamari Sharpe, Ponds' teammate, a fellow cornerback and another football player he grew up with in the Miami area, who secured the game-winning interception of quarterback Carson Beck at Hard Rock Stadium. </p><p>Following the game, the ESPN broadcast picked up an altercation in which Fletcher, who had two touchdowns for Miami in the 27-21 loss, threw a punch at Hoosiers' Tyrique Tucker. It may have escalated even more if Hurricanes teammates and staff members didn't hold back Fletcher as the celebration ensued for the Hoosiers. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href="http://FOXNEWS.COM"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Ponds was on hand with Sharpe and Hoosiers receiver Elijah Sarratt for a celebratory "shift" at Raising Cane's in Bloomington, Indiana. And before he met with the raucous fans outside, he spoke with Fox News Digital about that moment with Fletcher and Tucker. </p><p>"Those guys that were going at it, that’s a guy that I knew growing up and things like that," Ponds said of Fletcher, who attended American Heritage high school in Plantation, Florida, just a half hour away from Ponds' Chaminade-Madonna Prep. </p><p>"I don’t know the full story on that.
