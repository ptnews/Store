<p>Just two days after posting a social media video signaling his freedom from government office, former New York Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ericadams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Adams</a> slammed fellow Democrats over their response to President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>’s operation to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>Adams previously posted a video of himself with a cigar and what appeared to be bourbon, smiling as he lambasted the government as "slow as s---" filled with people trying to throw "sand in the gears" and predicting an "unforgettable, bada--, no bull---- 2026" – before issuing a starkly different message on Maduro than his mayoral successor.</p><p>By the weekend, Adams followed through, openly weighing in by thanking Trump for "hit[ting] the cartels where it hurts" through Maduro’s detention and sharply criticizing former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden’s approach to the Venezuelan strongman.</p><p>"I have seen firsthand how Nicolás Maduro destroyed Venezuela and turned it into a narco-state. Millions fled. Thousands landed in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York City</a>," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gregg-jarrett-no-trumps-order-snatch-maduro-not-illegal-unconstitutional" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GREGG JARRETT: NO, TRUMP'S ORDER TO SNATCH MADURO WAS NOT ILLEGAL OR UNCONSTITUTIONAL</strong></a></p><p>"Now in U.S. custody, the man who helped flood our streets with fentanyl is finally being held accountable. American lives were destroyed because of him."</p><p>Turning to those in his party, Adams said that days before Biden and Harris left office, they <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased the bounty on Maduro</a> to $25 million from an Obama-era $10 million.</p><p>Harris had said that Trump’s detaining of Maduro "do[es] not make America safer" and that the despot being an "illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-blasts-trump-administrations-capture-venezuelas-maduro-unlawful-unwise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlawful and unwise </a>… The American people do not want this, and they are tired of being lied to."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawmakers-rip-biden-after-trump-maduro-taunt-resurfaces-call-baseless-politically-charged" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LAWMAKERS RIP BIDEN AFTER TRUMP-MADURO TAUNT RESURFACES – CALL IT BASELESS AND POLITICALLY CHARGED</strong></a></p><p>"Public safety is not a political game," Adams replied to Harris.</p><p>"You do not label someone a narco-dictator one year and then pretend he is no longer a threat the next simply because a different president is in office – that is cynical and irresponsible," Adams said, citing Harris’ lengthier critique of the overnight operation.</p><p>Adams went on to cite real-life cases of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fentanyl deaths in New York</a> as proof of Maduro’s dangerous reach, including a two-year-old Bronx boy named Nicholas Feliz-Dominici whom he said was poisoned while in daycare.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/un-ambassador-waltz-defends-us-capture-maduro-ahead-security-council-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>UN AMBASSADOR WALTZ DEFENDS US CAPTURE OF MADURO AHEAD OF SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING</strong></a></p><p>"America is safer today because Maduro is no longer in power," the former NYPD officer turned mayor said.</p><p>"Welcome to New York, Nicolás."</p><p>Adams’ comments also directly contradicted the position of his successor, socialist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/zohran-mamdani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a>, who told reporters he personally telephoned Trump to "register my opposition."</p><p>"I was briefed this morning on the U.S. military <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-mayor-strongly-condemns-trumps-capture-venezuelan-leader-maduro-act-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capture of Venezuelan President</a> Nicolás Maduro and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City," Mamdani said in a statement.</p><p>"Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/international-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">violation of federal and international law</a>. This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home."</p><p>"My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance," the former Queens state assemblyman said.</p>
