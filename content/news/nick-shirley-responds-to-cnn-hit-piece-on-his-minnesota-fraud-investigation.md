<p>Independent journalist Nick Shirley commented Wednesday on his appearance in what he called a CNN "hit piece" targeting his reporting on alleged fraud at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/state-officials-daycare-manager-push-back-viral-video-fraud-allegations-minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota daycare centers</a>.</p><p>CNN correspondent Whitney Wild interviewed Shirley in a segment featured on "Anderson Cooper 360" Tuesday night, during which Wild questioned Shirley's methods of investigating the centers.</p><p>"But surely you don't think a daycare should just be unlocked?" Wild asked. "You shouldn't be able to just walk into a daycare."</p><p>"There should be a receptionist," Shirley replied.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/vp-debate-footage-walz-touting-state-support-daycares-goes-viral-amid-minnesota-fraud-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VP DEBATE FOOTAGE OF WALZ TOUTING STATE SUPPORT FOR DAYCARES GOES VIRAL AMID MINNESOTA FRAUD ALLEGATIONS</strong></a></p><p>"No, every daycare is locked," Wild responded.</p><p>"OK, you bring up a fair point. Then why can't they actually give me information how to enroll a child?" Shirley said.</p><p>Wild later asked Shirley how he knew the allegations he made against the daycare centers were true.</p><p>"How do I know that they're true? Well, we showed you guys what was happening, and then you guys can go ahead and make your own analysis," Shirley answered.</p><p>"So we can make our own analysis? Are you 100% sure you're true?" Wild asked.</p><p>"Yeah, I am 100% sure I'm true," Shirley said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/ice-probes-suspected-minnesota-fraud-sites-officials-follow-potential-9b-money-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ICE PROBES SUSPECTED MINNESOTA FRAUD SITES AS OFFICIALS FOLLOW POTENTIAL $9B MONEY TRAIL</strong></a></p><p>Shirley provided more background on the interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muItY6E4Wps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Valuetainment's "PBD Podcast."</a> He described Wild as "very friendly" but was surprised by her focus on the investigation rather than the daycare centers themselves.</p><p>"They put a hit piece out on me," he said. </p><p>"I'm like, 'Ma'am, you're defending fraud. Like, what are you talking about?'" Shirley said. "Like, the issue wasn't what time I showed up to the daycare. The issue is that this building right here is receiving $1.9 million, and it's not even operating. And they're showing [their] face right now while they're literally shuffling in kids while the commissioner of children is saying the daycare was closed last week."</p><p>During the segment, Shirley pushed back on Wild's questioning of his allegations.</p><p>"You're saying that this is a fraudulent daycare. There's kids being dropped off right now," Wild remarked.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-abby-phillip-calls-notion-no-one-being-held-accountable-minnesota-fraud-completely-false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CNN'S ABBY PHILLIP CALLS NOTION THAT 'NO ONE IS BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE' FOR MINNESOTA FRAUD 'COMPLETELY FALSE'</strong></a></p><p>CNN did not immediately respond to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox News Digital's</a> request for comment.  </p><p>Shirley went <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/feds-launch-massive-investigation-after-viral-video-alleges-minnesota-daycare-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viral over the weekend</a> for his 42-minute video investigating Minnesota daycare centers that appeared inactive despite receiving millions of dollars in government funding.</p><p>His video prompted investigations by federal officials, leading the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hhs-freezes-minnesota-child-care-payments-over-alleged-daycare-fraud-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freeze all childcare payments</a> to Minnesota.</p>
