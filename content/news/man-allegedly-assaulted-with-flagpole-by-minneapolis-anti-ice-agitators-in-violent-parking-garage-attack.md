The bleeding is natural for Nazis, but he needs mental help."</p><p>"F--- you Nazi," agitators shouted as they followed him into the garage.</p><p>One woman could be heard asking if the bloodied man needed help, to which he calmly replied, "No, I'm good. Thank you though, I appreciate you."</p><p>As he got into the car and sped away, the mob slammed on the doors and hit the vehicle with flagpoles.</p><p>It is unclear what led to the violent encounter.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/three-venezuelan-illegals-arrested-ice-officer-ambushed-attacked-traffic-stop-noem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>THREE VENEZUELAN ILLEGALS ARRESTED AFTER ICE OFFICER 'AMBUSHED AND ATTACKED' DURING TRAFFIC STOP: NOEM</strong></a></p><p>Earlier in the day, pardoned Jan. 6 rioter <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/anti-islam-protesters-muslims-clash-dearborn-michigan-after-man-attempts-burn-quran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Lang</a> was seen on video being dragged away from a demonstration by protesters.</p><p>Footage showed Lang bleeding from the back of the head as he stumbled through a crowd surrounding him.</p><p>Lang, who was pardoned after participating in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, was allegedly taking part in the Americans Against Islamification (AAI)'s "Crusader March on ‘Little Somalia,’" with the intention of burning a Quran at Minneapolis City Hall, when the incident took place.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/federal-agents-deploy-tear-gas-rubber-bullets-protesters-outside-minneapolis-federal-building" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FEDERAL AGENTS DEPLOY TEAR GAS, RUBBER BULLETS ON PROTESTERS OUTSIDE MINNEAPOLIS FEDERAL BUILDING</strong></a></p><p>Lang was seen on video trying to get into the back seat of an apparent good Samaritan's car, as agitators pulled the door back open, kicking into the vehicle.</p><p>A woman in the passenger seat could be heard telling protesters, "We don't know him, stop hitting our car."</p><p>Following the incident, Lang took to X, claiming he was also stabbed during the incident, but a plate carrier he was wearing blocked the attack.</p><p>"I was just literally LYNCHED by an anti white mob of liberals &amp; illegal immigrants- I’m at the hospital now getting staples in my skull… Nearly ripped limb from limb in Minneapolis!!!!"

"ICE working every single day to remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from terrorizing their state."</p>
