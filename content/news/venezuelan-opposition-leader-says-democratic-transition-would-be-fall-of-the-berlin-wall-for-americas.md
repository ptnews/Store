<p>Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado argued that a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rubio-lays-out-three-phase-plan-venezuela-after-maduro-not-just-winging-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful democratic transition</a> for her country would rapidly transform the nation's economy and reverse years of instability, reshaping the region’s political landscape.</p><p>Machado <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/01/26/us-news/maria-corina-machado-says-democracy-can-turn-venezuela-into-trumps-berlin-wall-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>told the New York Post</u></a> in an interview that such an outcome would define Trump’s foreign policy legacy, comparing it to the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><p>"The legacy to the world is going to be huge," she explained. "You’re going to have a prosperous Venezuela and the region.… If you make a comparison in history, this would mean for the Americas as much as the fall of the Berlin Wall had for Europe. It’s equivalent.</p><p>"For the first time in history, you will have the Americas free of communism, dictatorship and narco-terrorism for the first time," she added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/post-trump-meeting-venezuelan-opposition-leader-says-country-hold-free-fair-elections-eventually" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>POST TRUMP MEETING, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER SAYS COUNTRY WILL HOLD 'FREE AND FAIR' ELECTIONS 'EVENTUALLY'</strong></a></p><p>Machado said she intends to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/venezuelan-political-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return to Venezuela</a> soon to help drive a democratic transition despite the risks she faces under the country’s current government.</p><p>"I need to be there. I want to go back as soon as possible," Machado said.</p><p>Her planned return would come at a pivotal moment for Venezuela, as interim President Delcy Rodríguez leads a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cia-director-venezuela-meet-acting-president-delcy-rodriguez-official-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S.-backed transition following</a> the removal of Nicolás Maduro.</p><p>Rodríguez, a close ally of Maduro, was sworn into office on Jan. 5 after U.S. forces ousted the ex-leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their compound in Caracas during a military operation.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/venezuelan-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-presents-nobel-medal-trump-despite-institute-ban" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER MARÍA CORINA MACHADO PRESENTS NOBEL MEDAL TO TRUMP DESPITE INSTITUTE BAN</strong></a></p><p>The duo were flown to New York and arraigned in federal court on multiple charges to which they pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Rodríguez has since been working with the White House and has spoken with President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> by phone.</p><p>Machado, however, voiced deep reservations about Rodríguez’s leadership, warning that the transition risks falling short without a broader break from the Maduro-era government.</p><p>"If Delcy Rodríguez stays, nothing truly changes," she told the Post. "There will be no rule of law, no trust, no stability. Venezuelans will not come home under a criminal."</p>
