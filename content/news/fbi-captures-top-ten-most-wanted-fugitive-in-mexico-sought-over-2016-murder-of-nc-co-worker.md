<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/fbi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The FBI</a> announced on Saturday that it had arrested Alejandro Rosales Castillo, who has been a Ten Most Wanted Fugitive since 2017. </p><p>FBI Director Kash Parel said Castillo was arrested in Mexico on Friday. He had been wanted in connection to the 2016 murder of his former co-worker, 23-year-old "Sandy" Ly Le, in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/charlotte-raleigh-piedmont" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>.</p><p>"Alejandro Castillo is the fifth FBI Ten Most Wanted fugitive captured since last year, more than the entire previous four years combined. That reflects leadership, not luck," Patel said in a statement. "When law enforcement is given clear backing and the freedom to act, results follow. The work of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBI Charlotte field office</a>, our state and local partners, and Mexican authorities was exceptional, and this arrest finally opens the door to long-overdue justice for Sandy Ly Le’s family."</p><p>Rep.

The field office said Castillo is detained in Mexico and is awaiting extradition to North Carolina.</p><p>"The FBI and our partners at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department have worked tirelessly to find and arrest Alex Castillo. For more than nine years, he lived a normal life, likely believing he would never be captured, but our experienced investigators never gave up the hunt for justice," FBI Charlotte Special Agent in Charge James C. Barnacle Jr. said in a statement. "Sadly, Sandy’s family began another new year without her, we hope knowing her accused killer is in custody will provide some level of solace now."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/alleged-gang-hitman-captured-after-years-long-manhunt-3-separate-murders-philadelphia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ALLEGED GANG HITMAN CAPTURED AFTER YEARS-LONG MANHUNT FOR 3 SEPARATE MURDERS IN PHILADELPHIA: 'THE VERY WORST'</strong></a></p><p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chief of Police Estella D. Patterson said the case showed the power of law enforcement cooperation.</p><p>"This joint effort sends a clear message that those who commit violent crimes cannot outrun justice. Bringing this fugitive to justice makes Charlotte and other communities safer, and while nothing can heal the loss Sandy’s family has endured, we hope this step brings them some peace," Patterson said in a statement.</p><p>Russ Ferguson, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, also commented on the arrest, vowing that "those who engage in violence will not get away with it — no matter how hard they try."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-10-most-wanted-how-us-intelligence-determines-who-makes-notorious-criminal-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Castillo apparently owed</a> Le $1,000, and she disappeared after agreeing to meet with him at a gas station.
