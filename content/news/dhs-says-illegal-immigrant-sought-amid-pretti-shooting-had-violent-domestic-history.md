<p>The illegal immigrant being sought during the operation that resulted in the death of a 37-year-old U.S. citizen had a violent rap sheet that included domestic assault involving intentional bodily harm, according to federal officials.</p><p>Jose Huerta-Chuma ultimately escaped capture during the chaos, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/border-patrol-commander-spars-cnn-host-over-deadly-minnesota-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Border Patrol Cmdr.
