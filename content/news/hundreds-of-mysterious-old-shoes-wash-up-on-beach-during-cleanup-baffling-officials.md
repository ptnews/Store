<p>Hundreds of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old-fashioned shoes</a> recently washed up on a beach in Wales — and locals are still trying to figure out why.</p><p>Volunteers working for the Beach Academy CIC, an educational center in Porthcawl, found the shoes on Dec. 18 during their efforts on a rock pool restoration project.</p><p>The team was trying to clear out litter to help restore rock pools to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their natural state</a> when they found the cache.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/sarah-huckabee-sanders-kids-scream-excitement-unearthing-2000-year-old-treasure-west-bank-cave" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS' KIDS SCREAM WITH EXCITEMENT AFTER FINDING 2,000-YEAR-OLD COINS IN WEST BANK CAVE</strong></a></p><p>Beach Academy founder Emma Lamport told Fox News Digital the shoes were found in a small area of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ogmore Beach,</a> located in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. </p><p>About 200 shoes and soles were recovered, Lamport said, including men's, women's and children's footwear.</p><p>She outlined two theories about how they got there.</p><p>The strongest theory, she said, is that the shoes came from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/boating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 19th-century shipwreck</a> called the Frolic, which struck nearby Tusker Rock. The ship was carrying cargo from Italy at the time.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>"They were washed up the Ogmore River estuary and, every now and then, they appear… especially when there has been erosion of the river bank," said Lamport.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>The second theory is that, back in the 1960s, a local factory produced over 50,000 pairs of boots and shoes each week — and cobblers would dump any old boots that they couldn't mend into the Ogmore River.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the odd nature</a> of the discovery, Lamport said that "it seems the find is not unusual."</p><p>"The well-preserved leather shoes, blackened over time, that have been found recently are not the first that have been found in the area," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>"Locals have been relating stories of finding strange shoes along the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Wales coast.</a>"</p><p>Lamport also stressed that the age of the shoes has not been professionally verified yet, leaving the origin a mystery.</p><p>"Their future is also unknown," she said. </p><p>The Beach Academy will hold onto the shoes for now, and is open to lending them to Cardiff University as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/museums-exhibits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">educational artifacts</a> in the future.</p>
