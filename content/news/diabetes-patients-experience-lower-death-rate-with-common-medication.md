<p>A large new study suggests that statins may help more people with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes/diabetes-type-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type 2 diabetes</a> than previously thought.</p><p>Researchers found that the cholesterol-lowering drugs reduced the risk of death and serious cardiovascular events not only in high-risk patients, but also in those considered low-risk based on standard 10-year heart disease predictions, according to a press release.</p><p>While statins are commonly prescribed to people with diabetes, there has been uncertainty about whether patients with a low predicted risk of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> would benefit from taking them.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/simple-lifestyle-changes-could-slash-heart-attack-risk-millions-scientists-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SIMPLE LIFESTYLE CHANGES COULD SLASH HEART ATTACK RISK FOR MILLIONS, SCIENTISTS REPORT</strong></a></p><p>To explore this, researchers from the University of Hong Kong analyzed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health records</a> from a large U.K. medical database known as IQVIA Medical Research Data.</p><p>The study included adults aged 25 to 84 with type 2 diabetes who had no serious heart disease or liver problems when the study began. Participants were followed for as long as 10 years, allowing researchers to track long-term outcomes.</p><p>The researchers compared people who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started taking statins</a> with similar people who did not take them. </p><p>They also grouped patients based on their estimated 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, ranging from low-risk to higher-risk. This allowed them to assess whether statins were helpful only for higher-risk patients or across the board.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/simple-daily-habit-could-help-people-type-2-diabetes-manage-blood-sugar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SIMPLE DAILY HABIT COULD HELP PEOPLE WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MANAGE BLOOD SUGAR</strong></a></p><p>The results, which were published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, showed that statins were linked to meaningful benefits for all groups.</p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</u></strong></a></p><p>Adults with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type 2 diabetes</a> who took the medications were less likely to die from any cause and less likely to experience major cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or other serious heart-related complications.</p><p>These benefits were seen even among patients who were considered low-risk based on standard prediction tools, the researchers noted.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</u></strong></a></p><p>In terms of safety, the study claims to have found little cause for concern. A very small increase in muscle-related side effects, known as myopathy, was observed in one risk group. However, there was no increased risk of liver problems, which is often a concern with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statin use</a>.</p><p>There may be important differences among people that the data couldn’t fully capture, the researchers wrote in the study publication.</p><p>Some health-related factors that were not measured, such as lifestyle habits, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diet, exercise</a>, or how closely people follow medical advice, could have affected the outcome, they added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Also, some hospital events may not have been fully recorded in the data. That means a few hospitalizations or complications might have been missed or not counted, which could slightly affect the accuracy of the findings.</p><p>The researchers recommend that clinicians should consider the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential benefits</a> of statin therapy for most adults with type 2 diabetes, even when short-term cardiovascular risk appears low.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes should speak with their doctor before starting or changing statin therapy, as individual health factors, potential side effects and personal cardiovascular risk should be considered.</p>
