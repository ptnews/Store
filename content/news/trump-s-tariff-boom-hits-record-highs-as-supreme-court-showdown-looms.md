<p>The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling Friday in a case that could reshape President <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Donald Trump's</u></a> trade agenda.</p><p>At issue is the scope of presidential authority to impose tariffs under longstanding trade laws.</p><p>The cases stem from lawsuits filed by an educational toy manufacturer and a family-owned wine and spirits importer, with the court weighing whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorized the <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>tariffs</u></a> or whether the move exceeded constitutional limits.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/supreme-court-expected-rule-friday-trumps-power-impose-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SUPREME COURT EXPECTED TO RULE FRIDAY ON TRUMP'S POWER TO IMPOSE TARIFFS</strong></a></p><p>The Trump administration has invoked the IEEPA to impose five separate tariff measures — including reciprocal tariffs, fentanyl-related tariffs, tariffs tied to Russian oil imports currently levied on Indian goods, Brazil-related tariffs, and trade agreements negotiated with foreign countries under the law — a sweeping use of emergency powers now under scrutiny by the court.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-says-us-would-completely-destroyed-without-tariff-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP SAYS US WOULD BE 'DESTROYED' WITHOUT TARIFF REVENUE</u></strong></a></p><p>One of the most consequential of those measures came in April, when Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs, a broad set of import taxes he said were designed to correct long-standing <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-defends-tariffs-says-us-has-been-the-king-being-screwed-trade-imbalance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trade imbalances</a> and reduce the U.S. reliance on foreign goods.</p><p>The effect was immediate: duty collections jumped from $9.6 billion in March to $23.9 billion in May. Total duty revenue reached $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30, according to the Treasury Department’s "Customs and Certain Excise Taxes" report.</p><p>That momentum has carried into the new fiscal year, with more than $98 billion pouring into federal coffers since Oct. 1, <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Treasury data shows</u></a>.</p><p>The tariff windfall has emerged as a central pillar of Trump’s economic agenda, with the president arguing that tariffs can serve as a major source of government revenue to support domestic priorities.</p><p>On Nov. 9, Trump proposed using revenue from trade duties to provide a <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-calls-tariff-opponents-fools-promises-2000-dividend-payments-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>$2,000 dividend</u></a> to low- and middle-income Americans by mid-2026. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-tariff-funded-dividend-payments-americans-begin-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>TRUMP SAYS TARIFF-FUNDED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FOR AMERICANS WILL BEGIN NEXT YEAR</u></strong></a></p><p>Tariffs are taxes levied on imported goods. Although they are paid by companies at the border, the costs are often passed along through <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/bessent-defends-trumps-tariffs-against-claims-harm-us-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher prices</a>, leaving consumers to bear much of the burden.</p><p>He also said that any leftover funds could be used to pay down the nation’s debt, which stands just north of $38 billion.</p><p>During oral arguments in November, both conservative and liberal justices expressed doubts about the legality of the Trump administration’s tariffs.</p><p>A ruling expected this week will decide whether the tariffs and the revenue they generate can remain in place.</p><p>The Trump administration has said it could turn to alternative legal authorities to preserve the tariffs if the court rules against it.</p>
