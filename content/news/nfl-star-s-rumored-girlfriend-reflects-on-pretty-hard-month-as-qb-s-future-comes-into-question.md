<p>Model Olivia Ponton, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-burrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Burrow</a>’s rumored girlfriend, reflected on her year on social media in a two-day Q&amp;A session with her followers.</p><p>Ponton was asked about the "most difficult time of 2025." She pointed to the month of October as being quite difficult for her. At the same time, Burrow was rehabbing a turf toe injury that kept him sidelined until the Bengals’ <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/joe-burrow-shines-return-bengals-dominate-ravens-thanksgiving-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thanksgiving night game</a> against the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"October was a pretty hard month for me but thankfully I got this girl next to me," she wrote in response to the question.</p><p>After Burrow returned, he made some concerning comments about his future. The former LSU standout was asked whether his latest injury changed the way he viewed the game.</p><p>"It certainly doesn’t change my desire to win. If I wanna keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it," he said. "I’ve been through a lot and if it’s not fun, what am I doing it for? So, that’s the mindset I’m trying to bring to the table."</p><p>Burrow added that his mindset now was based on a reflection about his career.</p><p>"I’m not sure there was a singular moment or time," he said. "It’s reflection on a lot of things that I’ve done and been through in my career. I think I’ve been through more than most and it’s certainly not easy on the brain or the body. So, just trying to have fun doing it again."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-teams-should-expect-ricky-williams-type-price-tag-potential-joe-burrow-trade-talks-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NFL TEAMS SHOULD EXPECT 'RICKY WILLIAMS-TYPE' PRICE TAG IN POTENTIAL JOE BURROW TRADE TALKS: REPORT</strong></a></p><p>He also mentioned there were "a lot of things" going on in his personal and professional life, but didn’t elaborate further.</p><p>Still, Ponton suggested she was keeping a level head.</p><p>"2025 was a year of focusing on stability and consistency in 2026," she wrote.
