<p>Rose McGowan said Hollywood executives openly obsessed over her fluctuating weight during her stint on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shannen-dohertys-rivalry-alyssa-milano-caused-charmed-cast-divide-i-cried-every-single-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Charmed"</a> in the early 2000s. </p><p>During an appearance on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRBvUVNEBFk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">"We Need To Talk"</a> podcast, the 52-year-old actress — who joined the cast in 2001 — recalled how show executives would often mull over her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weight gain or loss</a>. </p><p>"They would circle around me to check my weight when I came back from season to season," she said, referencing show producers. "I think it was just really inspecting their product."</p><p>"There was no chill with it. It was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/drama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely fine to be that way</a>," she added. "Now they have to kind of pay lip service to being different."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shannen-dohertys-rivalry-alyssa-milano-caused-charmed-cast-divide-i-cried-every-single-night" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SHANNEN DOHERTY'S RIVALRY WITH ALYSSA MILANO CAUSED 'CHARMED' CAST DIVIDE: 'I CRIED EVERY SINGLE NIGHT'</strong></a></p><p>McGowan replaced original cast member, Shannen Doherty, in the fourth season. The series originally starred Doherty, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alyssa-milano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alyssa Milano</a> and Holly Marie Combs, and ran from 1998 to 2006.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS</strong></a></p><p>Doherty claimed "drama" on set sparked her early departure from the series in 2001, which ran for eight seasons until its final episode aired in 2006.</p><p>"There was too much drama on the set and not enough passion for the work. You know, I'm 30 years old, and I don't have time for drama in my life anymore," Doherty, who died in 2024, told Entertainment Tonight at the time of her departure.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>Following Doherty's exit from the show, Milano told Entertainment Weekly, "I think it's hard when you put two very different people together. I'm very laid-back and passive. I have my Buddha. I come in here and meditate. [Shannen's] got a lot of energy, she's very headstrong, she wants to get the job done."</p><p>McGowan is not the first actress to open up about the harsh criticism she received. </p><p>In 2021, Kate Winslet recalled "straight-up cruel" criticism of her weight. </p><p>"In my 20s, people would talk about my weight a lot. And I would be called to comment on my physical self," she told The Guardian at the time. "Well, then I got this label of being ballsy and outspoken. No, I was just defending myself."</p><p>"It was almost laughable how shocking, how critical, how straight-up cruel tabloid journalists were to me," Winslet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/feb/21/kate-winslet-ive-been-asked-so-many-times-about-the-intimate-scenes-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u>said</u></a>. "I was still figuring out who the hell I bloody well was! They would comment on my size, they’d estimate what I weighed, they’d print the supposed diet I was on. It was critical and horrible and so upsetting to read."</p><p>"It damaged my confidence," she added. "I didn’t want to go to Hollywood because I remember thinking, ‘God, if this is what they’re saying to me in England, then what will happen when I get there?’" she reminisced. "Also, it tampers with your evolving impression of what’s beautiful, you know? I did feel very on my own. For the simple reason that nothing can really prepare you for... that."</p>
