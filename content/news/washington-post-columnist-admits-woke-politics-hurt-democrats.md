<p>A Washington Post opinion columnist is acknowledging that the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/democratic-party" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democratic Party</a> pushed "woke" politics too far and paid the price at the ballot box. The piece argued that New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/zohran-mamdani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a> may represent the kind of shift away from culture war politics Democrats need to win back voters.</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/14/mamdani-democrats-woke/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Columnist Shadi Hamid argued</a> that from 2014 through about 2023, peaking in 2020, Democrats embraced "woke" ideas that prioritized divisive cultural issues, including transgender rights and calls to defund the police.</p><p>"A growing number of Democrats and liberals have acknowledged that things may have gone too far," Hamid said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-takes-heat-putting-spotlight-erika-kirks-wardrobe-wake-husbands-assassination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WASHINGTON POST TAKES HEAT FOR PUTTING SPOTLIGHT ON ERIKA KIRK’S WARDROBE IN WAKE OF HUSBAND’S ASSASSINATION</strong></a></p><p>"Alienating too many Americans who might have otherwise been sympathetic to [the] Democratic Party’s economic message but couldn’t get on board with an expansive and aggressive cultural agenda," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2025-shockers-biggest-moments-rocked-campaign-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>2025 SHOCKERS: THE BIGGEST MOMENTS THAT ROCKED THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL</strong></a></p><p>Hamid wrote in "How Mamdani shows Democrats the way beyond wokeness" that the party’s fixation on identity politics and DEI peaked around 2020 and eventually triggered a voter backlash that, he said, benefited President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>.</p><p>He points to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/david-hogg-celebrates-zohran-mamdanis-win-calls-dems-reignite-american-dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mamdani’s mayoral victory</a> as a potential blueprint for how Democrats can win back voters alienated by cultural politics. While Mamdani once supported the party’s more activist-based policies, he later backed away from that rhetoric during his mayoral bid.</p><p>"During his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaign for mayor</a>, Mamdani apologized for his comments," Hamid wrote, referring to Mamdani’s past description of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mamdani-forced-address-unearthed-video-exposing-vile-comment-nypd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Police Department</a> as "racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jonathan-turley-even-washington-post-admits-jack-smith-wrong-free-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JONATHAN TURLEY: EVEN THE WASHINGTON POST ADMITS JACK SMITH WAS WRONG ON FREE SPEECH</strong></a></p><p>The piece noted that while Mamdani shifted away from some activist rhetoric, he continued to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/first-fox-new-site-exposes-nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdanis-radical-record-his-own-words" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly support transgender rights,</a> including in a video released weeks before the November election.</p><p>Instead, the piece argued, Mamdani centered his campaign on everyday issues affecting New Yorkers, particularly affordability. Hamid wrote that Mamdani’s success reflects a broader shift within the Democratic Party, as culture war issues lose their appeal with voters.</p>
