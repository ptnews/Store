<p>Lamar Jackson will be back in the driver’s seat this Sunday as the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/baltimore-ravens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltimore Ravens</a> face the Pittsburgh Steelers in a win-or-go-home season finale. </p><p>The veteran quarterback missed the Ravens’ Week 17 matchup against the Green Bay Packers because of a back injury, and until his press conference with reporters on Thursday, there was serious doubt about whether he would play in the game that will determine the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AFC North</a> title.</p><p>"A hundred percent," Jackson told reporters when asked if he would start in Pittsburgh on Sunday. "I'm going to be out there."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>"I feel great right now." </p><p>Jackson did not play in last weekend’s game, but he returned to practice on Wednesday. He has not been through a full week of practice since early November and has missed four games this season, the first three because of a hamstring issue. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/steelers-aaron-rodgers-keeps-retirement-options-open-ahead-must-win-ravens-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>STEELERS' AARON RODGERS KEEPS RETIREMENT OPTIONS OPEN AHEAD OF MUST-WIN RAVENS GAME</u></strong></a></p><p>"I never quit on my team before. I never quit anything to be honest with you," Jackson continued. "I don't know where that noise came from."</p><p>With a 41-24 win at Green Bay and the Cleveland Browns’ 13-6 win over the Steelers, the Ravens have a shot at making the playoffs. A loss would send them packing. The same is true for Pittsburgh. </p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Steelers</a> host the Ravens Sunday night at 8:20 p.m. ET.</p><p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i></p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital’s</strong></i><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><strong><u> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
