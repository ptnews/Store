<p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/viral-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viral post</a> highlighting biometric surveillance at a Wegmans grocery store in New York City is sparking renewed privacy concerns.</p><p>"Biometric identifier information collected at this location," a sign attached to the door of a Wegmans reads.</p><p>"Wegmans <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food Markets</a>, Inc. collects, retains, converts, stores or shares customers' biometric identifier information, which may include" facial recognition, eye scans and voiceprints, the sign states.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/mcdonalds-locks-doors-keep-out-individuals-who-present-risk-crime-ridden-minneapolis-area" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MCDONALD'S LOCKS DOORS TO KEEP OUT INDIVIDUALS WHO PRESENT 'A RISK' IN CRIME-RIDDEN MINNEAPOLIS AREA</strong></a></p><p>Wegmans confirmed it is collecting the biometric readings, telling Fox News Digital in a statement the "safety of our customers and employees is a top priority."</p><p>The company went on, "Like many retailers, we use cameras to help identify individuals who pose a risk to our people, customers or operation. In a small fraction of our stores that exhibit an elevated risk, we have deployed cameras equipped with facial recognition technology."</p><p>Wegmans said the technology in New York City complies with local requirements.</p><p>"This technology is solely used for keeping our stores secure and safe. The system collects facial recognition data and only uses it to identify individuals who have been previously flagged for misconduct," Wegmans said.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/restaurant-bill-would-ban-plastic-utensils-condiment-packets-from-on-site-dining-circumstances"><strong><u>RESTAURANT BILL WOULD BAN PLASTIC UTENSILS AND CONDIMENT PACKETS FROM ON-SITE DINING IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES</u></strong></a></p><p>The Rochester, New York-based <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/grocery-bills-america-here-most-least-expensive-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grocery chain</a> said it retains images and videos of shoppers for "as long as necessary for security purposes" before disposing of them. </p><p>"For security reasons, we do not disclose the exact retention period, but it aligns with industry standards," Wegmans said.</p><p>"Persons of interest are determined by our asset protection team based on incidents occurring on our property and on a case-by-case basis, by information from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law enforcement</a> for criminal or missing persons cases."</p><p>Wegmans said it does not share biometric data with any third party.</p><p>"Facial recognition technology serves as one investigative lead for us.
