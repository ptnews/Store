<p>Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane, a retired general, gave a grave assessment of the state of the Iranian regime amid its <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crackdown on anti-government protests</a> and hinted at what could come next Friday on "Special Report."</p><p>"If I was in the Iranian regime, I would take President Trump dead serious here," Keane warned.</p><p>On Friday, President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a> warned in a Truth Social post that the U.S. is "locked and loaded and ready to go" if the Iranian regime shoots and kills protesters.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-us-intervene-iran-starts-killing-protesters-locked-loaded" target="_blank" rel="noopener">His message</a> comes as anti-regime demonstrations enter their second week and at least 44 protesters have been killed by Iranian security, according to the National Council of Resistance of Iran.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-protests-prompt-new-trump-warning-over-deadly-government-crackdowns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRAN PROTESTS PROMPT NEW TRUMP WARNING OVER DEADLY GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWNS</strong></a></p><p>Keane declared the Iranian regime is at its "weakest point" in 45 years with "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mike-pompeo-islamic-republic-ropes-time-trump-iranians-finish-job" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no prospect of recovering</a>."</p><p>Noting Trump’s warning under "no uncertain terms<i>," </i>Keane<i> </i>listed other key differences about the anti-regime protests that stood out to him from previous demonstrations in Iran.</p><p><strong>"</strong>Politically, [the Iranian regime] can't meet the social and political and economic aspirations of the people. Economically, they're in the tank, to be sure, and with no prospect of recovering," Keane added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-military-leader-threatens-preemptive-attack-after-trump-comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRANIAN MILITARY LEADER THREATENS PREEMPTIVE ATTACK AFTER TRUMP COMMENTS</strong></a></p><p>"And, militarily, they just lost a war. They've lost their platform in Syria. Their proxies are, by and large, decapitated and almost eliminated, to be sure," he added. "The result of all of that is they are in a fundamentally weak position, and it's serious in terms of the regime."</p><p>The retired U.S. Army general connected his assessment of the Iranian regime to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">civilian protests</a>.</p><p>"And when you have that, it also breeds discontent and breaks down trust and unity because people begin to fear about their own survival," he explained.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-supreme-leader-says-protesters-ruining-own-streets-please-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER BLAMES TRUMP FOR INCREASINGLY INTENSE DEMONSTRATIONS</strong></a></p><p>When Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked Keane what he thought about the probability of "some kind of strike" from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. or Israel</a> in support of anti-regime protesters happening soon, he did not offer a definitive answer.</p><p>"I think I would take <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the president serious</a>," he replied. "I have no insight into what they're thinking, but I'm listening to what they are saying. And he's dead serious."</p><p>Doubling down on his assertion, Keane appeared to refer to the U.S. military’s obliteration of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/nuclear-proliferation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iran’s nuclear enrichment sites</a> in 2025.</p><p>"Anybody at this point that doesn’t take President Trump serious when he’s saying something like this, given the last year, is certainly reckless and irresponsible," he stressed.</p>
