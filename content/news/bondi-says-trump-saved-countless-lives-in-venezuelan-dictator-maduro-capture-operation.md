<p>The capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro was "not just about drugs," U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in her first interview about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">military operation</a> on "Hannity" Monday.</p><p>Maduro and other defendants could face charges in other places, Bondi said.</p><p>"Nothing is off the table," Bondi told Fox News host Sean Hannity. "These people must remain behind bars. They are responsible for the loss of so many lives, and these aren't street-level drug dealers. They are narco-traffickers."</p><p>On Monday, Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/captured-venezuelan-dictator-maduro-faces-new-york-federal-judge-after-dramatic-palace-raid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>pleaded not guilty</u></a> to narco-terrorism and other charges in federal court.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rubio-defends-venezuela-operation-after-nbc-questions-lack-congressional-approval-maduro-capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>RUBIO DEFENDS VENEZUELA OPERATION AFTER NBC QUESTIONS LACK OF CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR MADURO CAPTURE</u></strong></a></p><p>The Justice Department says Maduro provided "Venezuelan diplomatic passports to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>drug traffickers</u></a> and facilitated diplomatic cover for planes used by money launderers to repatriate drug proceeds from Mexico to Venezuela."</p><p>A man who had a brief exchange with Maduro in the Manhattan court told Fox News the dictator <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maduro-appears-us-court-arraignment-questions-swirl-over-venezuelas-fate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>declared himself a "prisoner of war"</u></a> and compared himself to Jesus.</p><p>"I am innocent, I am not guilty," Maduro told the court.
