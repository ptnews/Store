<p>Martha Stewart has emphasized her focus on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy living</a>, as she remains physically active and engaged in business and creative pursuits well into her 80s.</p><p>On a recent episode of the podcast "50 &amp; Unfiltered," the lifestyle icon, 84, spoke with her longtime friend and colleague, QVC host Shawn Killinger, about a variety of topics, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including wellness</a>, resilience and living with a sense of purpose.</p><p>During the discussion, Stewart shared some of her top secrets to aging gracefully.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/creative-hobbies-keep-brain-young-study-finds-here-best-ones-pursue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CREATIVE HOBBIES KEEP THE BRAIN YOUNG, STUDY FINDS; HERE ARE THE BEST ONES TO PURSUE</u></strong></a></p><p>Stewart shared that she believes aging well is the result of consistent self-care, regular maintenance and long-term discipline rather than pursuing drastic fixes.</p><p><strong>"</strong>It doesn't appeal to me," she said when asked about her thoughts on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin/cosmetic-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic surgery</a>. "I have this theory that if one takes care of oneself really well and follows strict but not life-threatening kinds of disciplines, one can look good, feel good and be good for a whole life."</p><p>While Stewart has said that she avoids plastic surgery, she supports other people’s personal choices. On the podcast, she shared a story of her own mother’s experience.</p><p>"My mother came to me when she was 85 and asked if I would help her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get a facelift</a>," she said. Stewart then took her to see a well-known New York plastic surgeon.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/scientists-reveal-one-practice-could-prevent-dementia-you-age"><strong><u>SCIENTISTS REVEAL THE ONE PRACTICE THAT COULD PREVENT DEMENTIA AS YOU AGE</u></strong></a></p><p>"He looked at her and said, ‘You're a beautiful woman. I can't make you look younger, but I can make you look better,’" she recalled. "So she went for it… and she looked great."</p><p>Despite her lack of interest in going under the knife, Stewart acknowledged that maintaining her appearance requires ongoing effort. </p><p>"I'm 84 years old… and I'm trying so hard to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin/cosmetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look really good</a>," she said, sharing that she does have a facial wax every three months.</p><p>Stewart has credited her busy schedule and strong curiosity as key to staying <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharp and engaged</a> well into her 80s.</p><p>"I like to work, and I like to learn, and I like to go places, and I like to be busy," she replied when asked about her numerous commitments. "I like to be productive. One of my mottos is: Learn something new every day."</p><p>Stewart said her parents always encouraged her and her siblings to be "really, really proactively busy and [to] learn stuff."</p><p>When asked if she ever <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders/fatigue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gets tired</a>, Stewart admitted that she does, but said she doesn’t let fatigue slow her down. "I was sick for a week, but I had to keep working," she said. "I can never take off."</p><p>One of Stewart’s most widely known mottos is, "When you’re through changing, you’re through."</p><p>"Everybody says, ‘Oh, you're reinventing yourself,’" she said. "I’m not reinventing."</p><p>Instead, Stewart embraces the idea of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gradually, naturally evolving</a> — in everything from appearance to daily habits and career pursuits.</p><p>"To reinvent means total change — but you can't," she said. "I'm not changing my bodily shape or anything, except to get better, hopefully."</p><p>Persistence and resilience are key to overcoming setbacks and achieving goals, according to Stewart. </p><p>"I think I've always been tough," she said. "I've lived through it all. You can't be sensitive."</p><p>She also distinguishes between <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finding happiness</a> and being at peace with yourself.</p><p>"I'm happy with myself," Stewart added.</p><p>At 84, Stewart said she has "pretty much everything she needs," and expressed a desire to spend more time with her family.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES</strong></a></p><p>She also emphasized the importance of maintaining the physical capability to enjoy <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanding activities</a>, like hiding, horseback riding and rafting, all of which she planned to do during an upcoming family trip to Utah.</p><p>When the podcast conversation turned to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/martha-stewart-reveals-unconventional-end-of-life-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end-of-life plans</a>, Killinger asked Stewart about her thoughts on cremation. "I'm going to be composted," she replied.</p><p>When asked to elaborate, Stewart said her preference mirrors the burial of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/pets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her beloved animals</a> over the years.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>"When one of my horses dies, we dig a giant hole really deep in one of my fields," she shared. "We have a pet cemetery, and the horse is wrapped in a thin white linen sheet and is very carefully dropped down into this giant, lovely grave. I want to go there."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ</strong></a></p><p>When asked whether that’s allowed, Stewart said, "It's not going to hurt anybody. It's my property."</p><p>She added that traditional burial procedures, such as coffins and tombstones, don’t appeal to her.</p><p>Fox News Digital reached out to Stewart requesting comment.</p>
