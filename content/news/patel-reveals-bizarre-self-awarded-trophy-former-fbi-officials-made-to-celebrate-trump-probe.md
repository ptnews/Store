"CR-15" was printed along the base. CR-15 is a now-disbanded FBI unit that served as a public corruption squad. </p><p>"People ask why I said the old FBI was a diseased temple," Patel wrote on X. "This is what corruption looks like when it thinks no one is watching."</p><p>"I <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/corruption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disbanded CR-15</a> and removed the corrupt actors involved," he continued. "So when legacy media cries that President Trump’s FBI fired people and made sweeping changes, I have one response: You’re damn right we did."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-fires-agents-dismantles-corruption-squad-after-probe-unveils-monitoring-gop-senators-patel-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FBI FIRES AGENTS, DISMANTLES CORRUPTION SQUAD AFTER PROBE UNVEILS MONITORING OF GOP SENATORS, PATEL SAYS</strong></a></p><p>Patel’s comments come as Republican lawmakers continue to raise alarms about the FBI’s Arctic Frost probe, which later fed into former Special Counsel Jack Smith’s work.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jack-smith-meeting-then-fbi-director-wray-recorded-significant-case-notification-j6-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>JACK SMITH MEETING WITH THEN-FBI DIRECTOR WRAY RECORDED AS ‘SIGNIFICANT CASE NOTIFICATION’ IN J6 PROBE</strong></a></p><p>In October, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/chuck-grassley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa,</a> and Sen.
