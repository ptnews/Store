<p>A jury is hearing from teenagers who have testified about being victims of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California mom</a> facing dozens of charges after allegedly hosting secret "alcohol-soaked benders," in which high school freshmen were encouraged to engage in sexual behavior at her family’s swanky mansion.</p><p>Shannon O’Connor is on trial after she was slapped with 63 criminal charges stemming from her alleged involvement in throwing alcohol- and sex-fueled parties for minors during the 2020-21 school year in Santa Clara, <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/girls-treated-like-objects-at-los-gatos-party-moms-mansion-witness-testifies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><u>according to</u></a> KRON. </p><p>Deputy District Attorney Joanna Lee alleged O’Connor, who has been dubbed the "Los Gatos Party Mom," hosted "chaotic, alcohol-soaked benders," adding that "for many freshmen at Los Gatos High in 2020, their first experience with alcohol ended in overconsumption, vomiting and blackouts," the local outlet reported. "[O’Connor’s] house was a place for children to engage in sexual conduct. The defendant groomed the children, normalized sex, encouraged hookups and sexual behavior."</p><p>Many of the attendees were 14-year-old freshmen, with O’Connor allegedly serving as the only adult supervising the parties hosted up to five times a week, the outlet reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-party-mom-accused-throwing-drunken-teen-sex-parties-pleads-not-guilty" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CALIFORNIA 'PARTY MOM' ACCUSED OF THROWING DRUNKEN TEEN SEX PARTIES PLEADS NOT GUILTY</strong></a></p><p>Prosecutors allege O’Connor used her son’s status on the school’s football team and "cool mom" reputation to communicate daily with the freshmen through Snapchat without their parents’ knowledge. </p><p>On Tuesday, one female minor, identified as Jane Doe 6, testified the social environment at the gatherings was "misogynistic," while corroborating prior statements from victims alleging O’Connor pressured teens to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sneak out of their homes</a> to drink heavily and "hook-up." </p><p>Jane Doe 6 reportedly went on to allege her best friend, a 14-year-old girl identified as Jane Doe 4, experienced symptoms of depression and alcoholism after being sexually and physically abused by boys at the parties.</p><p>"[John Doe 7] would touch her in front of everybody," Jane Doe 6 told the court, according to KRON. "It was bad, it was weird."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mom-accused-holding-booze-fueled-teen-sex-parties-indicted-slew-felonies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>MOM ACCUSED OF HOLDING BOOZE-FUELED TEEN SEX PARTIES INDICTED ON SLEW OF FELONIES</u></strong></a></p><p>The young girl reportedly went on to testify that when John Doe 7 drank alcohol, he would act violently toward the girls at the parties and "no one reacted to it." </p><p>"On one occasion, Jane Doe 4 was sitting in [O’Connor’s] kitchen in her swimsuit when John Doe 7 began to punch Jane Doe 4 on her leg," Lee wrote in court documents. [O’Connor] was drinking a glass of champagne and laughed as she watched. John Doe 7 stood over her and continued to kick her legs and stomach all while [O’Connor] was sitting in the kitchen."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/parents-california-mom-shannon-oconnor-sex-parties-teens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>PARENTS REVEAL SORDID DETAILS OF HOW THEY HELPED NAB CALIFORNIA MOM THROWING TEEN SEX PARTIES</u></strong></a></p><p>Jane Doe 6 told the prosecution that her friend "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was totally alcohol dependent</a>" and "had to take shots of alcohol before she could leave her house." </p><p>The mother of Jane Doe 4 also took the stand this week, telling the court her daughter first visited O’Connor’s home in the fall of 2020 to work on a school science project with O’Connor’s son, KRON reported.</p><p>"It all seemed normal in the beginning. She was an innocent kid. She’d never dated," the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mother said</a>, adding that when she dropped Jane Doe 4 off at the house, "It was a very fancy, beautiful home. [O’Connor’s] son seemed like a nice kid."</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-mom-drunken-parties-teens-sex-assault" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CALIFORNIA MOM THREW TEENS SECRET DRINKING PARTIES, WATCHED SEX ABUSE: AUTHORITIES</u></strong></a></p><p>After the child made several trips to O’Connor’s home, her behavior changed, the mother testified, adding her daughter acted "really tired" and "closed off," according to KRON. </p><p>Jane Doe 4’s mother went on to add that she confronted her daughter after noticing bruises on her body, but her concerns were brushed off. </p><p>One night, the mother noticed Jane Doe 4’s breath smelled like alcohol and told her, "no matter what it is, I will help you," KRON reported. The mother added that her child felt "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of shame</a>" and "was trying to escape."</p><p>O'Connor's attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. </p><p>Another mother reportedly told the jury in previous testimony that she "100 percent trusted [O’Connor]. As a mom, I have guilt for not seeing the signs sooner." </p><p>O’Connor has <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded not guilty</a> to all charges.</p>
